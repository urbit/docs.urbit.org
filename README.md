# Urbit Docs

This is the Markdown source content for the Urbit Docs, currently hosted on GitBook at [docs.urbit.org](https://docs.urbit.org).

## Contributing

You can contribute to the docs by cloning this repo and making a PR to the `master` branch, or with the "Edit on GitHub" button on the relevant page of docs.urbit.org.

Before submitting a PR, please consult the [docs style guide](https://docs.urbit.org/style).

New files added in the `/content` folder should be added to the table of contents in [`SUMMARY.md`](./content/SUMMARY.md).

When you submit a PR, GitBook will build a preview of what the live content will look like. You should check that preview before requesting a review.
