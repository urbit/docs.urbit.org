# Urbit Docs

## What is Urbit?
Urbit is a simple personal server (Urbit OS), a peer-to-peer network of those servers, and a decentralized identity standard (Urbit ID) for that network and beyond.

You can [get on Urbit](get-on-urbit.md) in a few clicks with cloud hosting or host your server on your own machine at home.

## What is this site?
The Urbit docs are for developers and self-hosted users. Developers can find [courses](build-on-urbit), guides, and reference material for [Urbit ID](urbit-id) and [Urbit OS](urbit-os). The [manual](manual) section covers everything that users need to run their own server.
