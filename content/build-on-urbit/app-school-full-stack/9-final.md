# 9. Summary

That's it! We've built our agent and React front-end, put together a desk and published it. We hope this walkthrough has helped you see how all the pieces for together for building and distributing an app in Urbit.

The reference material for each section of this walkthrough is listed [below](#reference-material), the source code for our app is available [here](https://github.com/urbit/docs-examples/tree/main/journal-app), and it can be installed from `~pocwet/journal`.

In this guide we've built a separate React app for the front-end, but Hoon also has a native domain-specific language for composing HTML structures called Sail. Sail allows you to compose a front-end inside a Gall agent and serve it directly. See the [Sail guide](../../hoon/sail.md) for details.

Along with `@urbit/http-api`, there's also the `@urbit/api` NPM package, which contains a large number of helpful functions for dealing with Hoon data types and interacting with a number of agents - particularly those used by the Groups app. Its source code is [available here](https://github.com/urbit/js-http-api).
