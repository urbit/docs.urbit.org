# Core Academy

Core Academy prepares [Hoon](../../hoon/why-hoon.md) developers to become [Arvo](../../urbit-os/what-is-urbit-os.md) kernel developers. While only [Hoon School](../hoon-school/) is strictly necessary to follow this material, readers should be capable of writing fairly complex applications in Hoon. Some knowledge of C and/or Rust is also necessary for some of the runtime material.

This written course is adapted from the teaching notes for the 2023 cohort of Core Academy, its first and to-date only live cohort. The course explores each part of Arvo, [Zuse](../../glossary/zuse.md), Hoon, and the runtime to contextualize how Urbit works today and where further development is needed.

_The lesson notes represent a snapshot of Urbit core development at Zuse 412k and Vere 2.12. Some details have changed since that release._

Video recordings of the 2023 Core Academy are [available to watch here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYGEMSwLguIGgrEGwxu2AAbESpfF_LRKx). The order in which vanes are covered differs between this written material and the recorded lectures, but aside from some Q\&A in the lectures it's all the same information.
