# Apps

Gall is one of the nine vanes (kernel modules) of Arvo, Urbit's operating system. Gall's purpose is to manage userspace applications called _agents_. **Agents** are the main kind of userspace application on Urbit. They have a persistent state and API that handles events and produces effects.Gall agents can variously be treated as databases with developer-defined logic, services, daemons, or a kind of state machine.

One or more Gall agents can be put together in a "desk" in Clay (the filesystem vane) and, along with a front-end, can be published and distributed as a cohesive app for users to install.

This section of the docs contains guides related to writing apps and [distributing them](guides/software-distribution.md). It also contains a number of different [examples and exercises](examples) you can work through to learn how to build different kinds of apps.

- [Reference](reference) - Reference information about apps and software distribution.
- [Guides](guides) - Guides to things like software distribution, CLI apps and remote scries.
- [Examples](examples) - A workbook of app exercises and examples.

Additionally, the [courses](../../build-on-urbit) section of the docs contain two in-depth app-building tutorials, which are the recommended place to start learning Urbit app development:

- [App School](../../build-on-urbit/app-school) - Learn the basics of app development.
- [App School II](../../build-on-urbit/app-school-full-stack) - Learn to build and publish a full app, back-end and front-end.
