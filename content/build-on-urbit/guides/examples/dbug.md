# Debugging Wrapper

The `/lib/dbug.hoon` agent wrapper adds support to view the state of a Gall agent.  It is applied to an existing Gall agent as a single drop-in line, `%-  agent:dbug`.

Before we look at the code, let's consider the functionality it exposes.  By supplying `%-  agent:dbug`, an associated `+dbug` generator can be invoked against the agent state.

For instance, using the `%azimuth` agent, we can expose the current state of the agent:

```hoon
> :azimuth +dbug
[ %7
  url=~.
  net=%default
  refresh=~m5
  whos={}
  nas=[%0 points={} operators={} dns=<||>]
  own={}
  spo={}
  logs=~
  sap=[%0 id=[hash=0x0 number=0] nas=[%0 points={} operators={} dns=<||>] owners={} sponsors={}]
]

> :azimuth +dbug %bowl
>   [ [our=~zod src=~zod dap=%azimuth]
  [wex={} sup={}]
  act=3
    eny
  0v1rn.n49dr.2u8t5.h7be5.6dcq7.9hon5.6m3pr.3hcb8.u7tmv.qddpq.kent7.1ftc7.9tao6.hfsht.4i0c3.ak3t7.t8d8j.nn4eb.b7eh3.4d5pr.t8ftg
  now=~2023.2.3..20.03.23..f60e
  byk=[p=~zod q=%base r=[%da p=~2023.1.26..02.41.25..926a]]
]

> :azimuth +dbug [%incoming ~]
>   no matching subscriptions

> :azimuth +dbug [%state '(lent whos)']
>   0
```

There are four actions exposed by the wrapper via the `+dbug` generator:

1. `:app +dbug` exposes the entire state, just dumping the current agent state.
2. `:app +dbug %bowl` shows the agent's `bowl`.  The Gall `bowl` consists of:
    
    ```hoon
    +$  bowl              ::  standard app state
      $:  $:  our=ship    ::  host
              src=ship    ::  guest
              dap=term    ::  agent
          ==              ::
          $:  wex=boat    ::  outgoing subs
              sup=bitt    ::  incoming subs
          ==              ::
          $:  act=@ud     ::  change number
              eny=@uvJ    ::  entropy
              now=@da     ::  current time
              byk=beak    ::  load source
      ==  ==              ::
    ```

3. `:app +dbug [%state 'hoon']` exposes data in the state, including evaluated Hoon like `(lent values)`.
4. `:app +dbug [?(%incoming outgoing) specifics]` reveals details about the subscriptions.

As we examine this code, there are two particularly interesting aspects:

1. How `/lib/dbug.hoon` modifies an agent's arms by adding functionality over the top of them.
2. How `/gen/dbug.hoon` utilizes the modified arms with an elegant and simple invocation.

There is also extensive use of `tank`/`tang` formatted error messaging.

## How the library works {#how-the-library-works}

By applying this door builder using `%-` censig, the `++on-poke` and `++on-peek` arms can be modified.  (In fact, all of the arms can be modified but most of the arms are pass-throughs to the modified agent.)

</details>

The `++on-poke` arm has several branches added to it after a check to see whether it is being used through the `+dbug` generator.  If it isn't (as determined by the associated `mark`), then the poke is passed through to the base agent.

```hoon
?.  ?=(%dbug mark)
  =^  cards  agent  (on-poke:ag mark vase)
  [cards this]
```

The following `?-` wuthep handles the input arguments:  `%state` is the most interesting code in this library.  The code first checks whether the base agent has a `/dbug/state` peek endpoint already (in which case it passes it through), otherwise it evaluates the requested Hoon expression against the agent's state (obtained via `++on-save:ag`).

```hoon
  %state
=?  grab.dbug  =('' grab.dbug)  '-'
=;  product=^vase
  [(sell product)]~
=/  state=^vase
  ::  if the underlying app has implemented a /dbug/state scry endpoint,
  ::  use that vase in place of +on-save's.
  ::
  =/  result=(each ^vase tang)
    (mule |.(q:(need (need (on-peek:ag /x/dbug/state)))))
  ?:(?=(%& -.result) p.result on-save:ag)
%+  slap
  (slop state !>([bowl=bowl ..zuse]))
(ream grab.dbug)
```

This branch includes the use of a rare [`=?` tiswut](../../../hoon/reference/rune/tis.md#tiswut) conditional leg change and the reversed `=/` tisfas, [`=;` tismic](../../../hoon/reference/rune/tis.md#tismic).  There is also some direct compilation of `cord`s taking place:

- [`++sell`](../../../hoon/reference/stdlib/5c.md#sell) is a `vase` pretty-printer.
- [`++slop`](../../../hoon/reference/stdlib/5c.md#slop) conses two `vase`s together as a cell. 
- [`++slap`](../../../hoon/reference/stdlib/5c.md#slap) compiles a Hoon expression and produces a `vase` of the result.
- [`++ream`](../../../hoon/reference/stdlib/5d.md#ream) parses a `cord` to a Hoon expression.

#### `++on-peek`

<details>
<summary>++on-peek</summary>

```hoon
  ++  on-peek
    |=  =path
    ^-  (unit (unit cage))
    ?.  ?=([@ %dbug *] path)
      (on-peek:ag path)
    ?+  path  [~ ~]
      [%u %dbug ~]                 ``noun+!>(&)
      [%x %dbug %state ~]          ``noun+!>(on-save:ag)
      [%x %dbug %subscriptions ~]  ``noun+!>([wex sup]:bowl)
    ==
```

</details>

The `++on-peek` arm adds several peek endpoints which expose the state (via `++onsave:ag`) and the subscriptions.

```hoon
> .^(noun %gx /(scot %p our)/azimuth/(scot %da now)/dbug/subscriptions/noun)
[0 0]
```

## How the generator works {#how-the-generator-works}

The generator explicitly injects the `%dbug` mark in its return `cask` (`[mark noun]`).  This is a valid if uncommon operation, and it works here because the mark is never used as a transforming gate but only as a marker to see whether the arms need to pass through the values.  The no-argument input is routed through the `%state` with an empty `cord`.

```hoon
:-  %dbug
?-  args
  ~          [%state '']
  [@ ~]      ?-(what.args %bowl [%bowl ~], %state [%state ''])
  [[@ *] ~]  poke.args
==
```

Library authors should consider augmenting developer capabilities by exposing appropriate functionality using a wrapper agent similar to `/lib/dbug`.
