# Styled Text

In this tutorial, we examine how to produce `styx` styled text strings and output them to the terminal from an agent.

## `%shoe` CLI Session Manager {#shoe-cli-session-manager}

`%shoe` is responsible to manage attached agent sessions.  It adds a few arms to the standard Gall agent, namely:

- `++command-parser` is the input parser, similar to the work we were carrying out just above.  This parses every input and only permits valid keystrokes (think of Dojo real-time parsing).
- `++tab-list` provides autocompletion options.  We can ignore for now.
- `++on-command` is called whenever a valid command is run.  This produces the actual effects.
- `++can-connect` supports `|dojo/link` connexion to the app.
- `++on-connect` provides particular session support when a user connects.  We can ignore for now.
- `++on-disconnect` provides particular session support when a user disconnects.  We can ignore for now.

To get started with text parsers and CLI agents, we need to focus on `++command-parser` and `++on-command`.  But first, the agent's structure and state:


The agent will adopt a two-stage process, wherein a value is put on the stack then the stack is checked for any valid operations.

### `++command-parser` {#command-parser}

The input parser can simply accept whole words or single inputs, or parse complex expressions (as Dojo does with Hoon).

This results in a noun of `+$command-type` based on the specific application.  The example `/app/shoe.hoon` agent defines:

```hoon
+$  command
  $?  %demo
      %row
      %table
  ==
```

and later uses this as:

```hoon
  ++  command-parser                                                                            
    |=  =sole-id:shoe
    ^+  |~(nail *(like [? command]))
    %+  stag  &
    (perk %demo %row %table ~)
```

where the unfamiliar parser components are:

- `++stag` adds a label, here `&` pam `TRUE`/`%.y` to indicate that the command should be run immediately when it matches.  (We won't want this below so we will `++stag` a `|` `FALSE`/`%.n`.)
- `++perk` parses a fork in the type.

### `++on-command` {#on-command}

This arm accepts a session ID and a command resulting from `++command-parser`.  It produces a regular `(quip card _this)` so you can modify agent state and produce effects here.


## `%sole` Effects {#sole-effects}

`%sole` is responsible for producing effects.  If you want to yield effects to the command line from your CLI agent (which you often do), this is a great place to work.

`%sole-effect`s are head-tagged by time and produce a variety of terminal effects, from text to bells, colors, and other screen effects.


## `$styx` Styled Text String {#styx-styled-text-string}

A `klr` effect uses a `styx`, or styled text string.  The relevant data structures are in `/sys/lull.hoon`:

```hoon
+$  deco  ?(~ %bl %br %un)                              ::  text decoration
+$  stye  (pair (set deco) (pair tint tint))            ::  decos/bg/fg
+$  styl  %+  pair  (unit deco)                         ::  cascading style
          (pair (unit tint) (unit tint))                ::
+$  styx  (list $@(@t (pair styl styx)))                ::  styled text       
+$  tint  $@  ?(%r %g %b %c %m %y %k %w %~)             ::  text color
          [r=@uxD g=@uxD b=@uxD]                        ::  24bit true color
```

- `$deco` is a text decoration, here `%bl` blinking, `%br` bright (bold), and `%un` underlined.
- `$tint` is a color, either explicitly the terminal red/green/blue/cyan etc. or a 24-bit true color value.
- `$stye` composes these into a style which will be applied to a string.
- `$styl` similarly composes styles together.
- `$styx` pairs styles with cords.

This means that composing styled text correctly can require explicitly nesting statements in rather a complicated way.

For instance, to produce a bold string with hex color `#123456`, we could produce the `sole-effect`:

```hoon
^-  sole-effect:sole
:-  %klr
^-  styx
~[[[`%br ~ `[r=0x12 g=0x34 b=0x56]] 'Hello Mars!' ~]]
```

## Agent Logic {#agent-logic}

Here is an agent that will accept a single character and produce a line with varying random colors of that character.

**`/app/track7.hoon`**

```hoon
