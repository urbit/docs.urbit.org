# Runtime

These guides cover Urbit's runtime and Nock interpreter, which is called Vere.

* [U3 Overview](concepts/u3.md) - An overview of the noun-wrangling part of the runtime, U3.
* [Conn.c Guide](guides/conn.md) - Using `conn.c` to interact with a running ship from the outside.
* [How to Write a Jet](guides/jetting.md) - A jetting guide by for new Urbit developers.
* [C3: C in Urbit](reference/c.md) - Under u3 is the simple c3 layer, which is just how we write C in Urbit.
* [U3: Land of Nouns](reference/nouns.md) - The division between c3 and u3 is that you could theoretically imagine using c3 as just a generic C environment. Anything to do with nouns is in u3.
* [U3: API Overview](reference/api.md) - A walkthrough of each of the u3 modules.
* [Cryptography](reference/cryptography.md) - References on the cryptography libraries utilized by jets.
