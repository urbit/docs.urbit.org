# Using conn.c

## Background {#background}

Prior to 2022, the only way to interact with a running ship from Earth was via HTTP requests sent to the `%lens` agent. In addition to `%lens`, there was a Python script helper named `herb` which would automatically format HTTP requests for `%lens` based on user inputs. However, there were several pain points for using `%lens` and `herb`. `%lens`, `herb`, and the difficulties of using them are documented more fully [here](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/6418).

Unrelated to the above, inconveniences around writing boilerplate code to interact with the `%spider` agent was hampering adoption of threads outside of the Arvo kernel.

## Present {#present}

Starting in 2022, tools for solving the above issues began to appear (though work on them began in 2021). In order, they are:
- `conn.c`
- The Khan vane
- The `urbit eval` utility
- `-eval` and `-khan-eval`
- The click thin client

Together, these tools are the building blocks for performing any action on a running ship (poke, scry, or command) from Earth, and receiving back programmatically usable output.

### `conn.c` {#connc}

[`conn.c`](https://github.com/urbit/vere/blob/develop/pkg/vere/io/conn.c) is a driver in Vere. It is a part of the "King" (a.k.a. "Urth") process. It exposes a [Unix domain socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) at `/path/to/pier/.urb/conn.sock` for sending/receiving data from external processes.

Input to `conn.c` must be a newt-encoded jammed noun that fits mold `[request-id command arguments]`, where:
- `request-id` is a client-supplied atomic identifier with type `@`. It exists entirely for the benefit of the client, allowing responses to be matched to requests.
- `command` is one of:
    - `%peek`
    - `%peel`
    - `%ovum`
    - `%fyrd`
    - `%urth`

These commands cover all possible cases for the following 2x2 matrix:
|          | poke             | scry    |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **vere** | `%urth`          | `%peel` |
| **arvo** | `%ovum`, `%fyrd` | `%peek` |

For a valid command, the output from `conn.c` is a newt-encoded jammed noun with type `[request-id output]`, where:
- `request-id` matches the input `request-id`
- `output` depends on the `command`

For an invalid command, the output from `conn.c` is a newt-encoded jammed noun with type `[0 %bail error-code error-string]`. However, `conn.c` makes no guarantees that:
- It will be able to sufficiently recover from the error to guarantee this output
- It will produce a meaningful error code and message

#### `%ovum`

The argument to an `%ovum` command is a raw kernel move which is injected directly into the Arvo event loop. This is a very powerful - and potentially dangerous - tool. For example, if a ship somehow got into a state where Clay was no longer working properly (meaning new files could not be compiled to fix the state of the kernel), the source code for a new, working Clay could be directly injected into the ship using an `%ovum`.

The output of an `%ovum` command is:
- `[%news %done]` if the move completed successfully
- `[%news %drop]` if the move was dropped
- `[%bail goof]` if an error occurred

#### `%fyrd`

`%fyrd` is a direct shortcut to the Khan vane. The Khan vane coordinates and manages threads, and is described in further detail below. The arguments to a `%fyrd` command are (in order):
1. The name of the desk in which the thread lives (e.g. `%base`) or `beak` for the thread (e.g. `[%zod %base %10]`)
2. The name of the thread (e.g. `%hi`)
3. Mark to which the output should be cast (e.g. `%tape`)
4. Mark for how to interpret the input argument to thread (e.g. `%ship`)
5. Input argument to thread (e.g. `~zod`)

The output of a `%fyrd` command is `[%avow (each page goof)]`, the value of `each` depending on whether the thread succeeded or not.

#### `%urth`

The argument to the `%urth` command is a subcommand for the action to perform. Currently, the only valid commands are `%pack` and `%meld`.

`%urth` will return `%&` if given a valid command as input, otherwise it will return `[0 %bail 0xfffffff9 %urth-bad]`. No other output is emitted.

#### `%peek`

The `%peek` command is used to perform a namespace read request (a.k.a. scry) using Arvo's external peek interface ([arm +22 in arvo.hoon](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/develop/pkg/arvo/sys/arvo.hoon#L1774)). The argument to `%peek` is the `nom` input to `+peek` in `arvo.hoon` (`lyc` is auto-filled as `[~ ~]`, i.e. "request from self"). That is to say that the argument to `%peek` must have type:
```
$+  each  path
$%  [%once vis=view syd=desk tyl=spur]
    [%beam vis=view bem=beam]
==
```
Practically speaking, this means that the input will look like one of these three examples:
```
[%& p=path]
[%| p=[%once vis=view syd=desk tyl=spur]]
[%| p=[%beam vis=view bem=beam]]
```
Where:
- `path` is a `[view beam]`, with the `view` passed in as a `coin`
- `view` is the vane code for the scry, as well as an optional care, possibly appended to the vane (e.g. `%j`, `%gx`, etc.)
- `beam` is a `[beak spur]`
- `desk` is used to auto-generate a `beak`: `[our desk now]`
- `spur` is the scry endpoint for the agent or vane

The output of a `%peek` command is `[%peek (unit (unit scry-output))]`, where `~` means that the scry endpoint is invalid, and `[~ ~]` means that the scry resolved to nothing.

See [here](../../../build-on-urbit/app-school/10-scry.md) for more information on scrying.

#### `%peel`

`%peel` attempts to emulate a scry-like namespace, like the one used by Arvo and accessed by `%peek`. The argument to `%peel` should be a path. Valid paths result in a non-null `unit` containing the result of the scry. Invalid paths result in null (i.e. `~`). The valid paths and the data they return are:
```
/help   (unit (list path))  Supported %peel paths
/live   (unit ~)            Pier health check; succeeds if pier is running
/khan   (unit ~)            Khan health check; succeeds if Khan vane is running
/info   (unit mass)         Pier info as a mass
/v      (unit @t)           Returns version of the Vere binary as a cord
/who    (unit @)            Returns the Azimuth identity of the ship as an atom
```

Note that the pier info above is returned as a `mass` report, i.e. type `(pair cord (each * (list mass)))`. This is not the same as the `|mass` memory report. `/mass` is meant to be a valid `%peel` path which returns the `|mass` memory report, but it is currently unimplemented.

### Khan {#khan}

The Khan vane is a command / response interface for running threads. Khan was introduced to make running threads a kernel-level feature, as simple as poking an agent or setting a timer. Threads allow users to run arbitrarily complex code on their ships in the same way that bash allows them to do so on Linux.

Khan's API exposes three thread requests:
- `%fard`: Kernel thread requests
- `%fyrd`: External thread requests
- `%lard`: "Inline" thread requests

"Kernel" above doesn't mean that this interface is hidden or protected from userspace agents; thread requests by userspace agents should almost certainly use `%fard`. It just means that `%fard` thread requests are expected to originate from within the kernel or a userspace agent.  Specifically:
- `%fard` commands take the thread input argument as a `cage`
- The data in the `vase` of the `cage` is a `unit` (as expected by `%spider`)
- The output is also a `cage` (see below for more information)

`%fyrd` thread requests, on the other hand, perform some extra services that are useful when running threads from the dojo or via `conn.c`. Specifically:
- `%fyrd` commands take the thread input as a raw `noun`
- Khan performs mark conversion on both the input and output for `%fyrd` requests
- Khan automatically lifts the converted input into a `unit`

"Inline" threads are a particularly specialized Khan thread request where the thread has already been compiled and is passed as a part of the input.

Khan requests expect the following input:
- `%fard`: `p=[=bear name=term args=cage]`
- `%fyrd`: `p=[=bear name=term args=(pair mark page)]`
- `%lard`: `[=bear =shed]`

Where:
- `bear` is a `desk` or a `beak`; if `bear` is a `desk`, then the it will be converted to a `beak` using `our` and `now` as default values
- `shed` is a pre-computed chain of strands that produce a `vase` (the canonical thread)

All three produce the same output if an error occured while running the thread: `[vow %| goof]`, where `vow` is `%arow` for `%fard` and `%lard`, and `%avow` for `%fyrd`.

If the thread succeeded, `%fard` and `%lard` produce `[%arow %& %noun vase]`. `%fyrd` produces `[%avow %& mark noun]`, where `mark` is the output mark and `noun` is the output as a raw noun after mark conversion.

See [here](../../../userspace/threads/tutorials/basics/fundamentals.md) for more information about threads.

### `urbit eval` {#urbit-eval}

`eval` is a utility command in the Urbit binary. Originally, it was introduced to evaluate snippets of Hoon code using the binary to emulate Arvo from the associated ivory pill. This allowed it to run any Hoon code fragments that used kernel and STL functions (e.g. anything in `hoon.hoon`, `arvo.hoon`, `lull.hoon`, and `zuse.hoon`). Notably, this did not (and does not) evaluate any Hoon fragments that require pier state (e.g. scries, `our`, `now`, etc.).

Example:
```
$ echo '(add 2 2)' | ./urbit eval
loom: mapped 2048MB
lite: arvo formula 2a2274c9
lite: core 4bb376f0
lite: final state 4bb376f0
eval (run):
4
```
The result (i.e. `4`) is printed to `stdout`. If the command had failed to compile, the stack trace would have been printed to `stdout` instead. All other messages are printed to `stderr`.

#### Options

`eval` was extended with several options that make it useful for processing Hoon nouns as input to or output from `conn.c`:
- `-j`, `--jam`: output result as a jammed noun
- `-c`, `--cue`: read input as a jammed noun
- `-n`, `--newt`: write output / read input as a newt-encoded jammed noun, when paired with `-j` or `-c` respectively
- `-k`: treat the input as the jammed noun input of a `%fyrd` request to `conn.c`; if the result is a `goof`, pretty-print it to `stderr` instead of returning it

### `-eval` and `-khan-eval` {#eval-and--khan-eval}

Two threads that evaluate arbitrary Hoon were added to the suite of threads included with Arvo: [`ted/eval.hoon`](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/develop/pkg/arvo/ted/eval.hoon) and [`ted/khan-eval.hoon`](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/develop/pkg/arvo/ted/khan-eval.hoon).

Both threads take the same input: Hoon code as a `cord` and an optional `(list path)`. The optional `(list path)` is a list of Clay file dependencies which need to be included for the Hoon to be evaluated (i.e. if the Hoon code includes libraries or types defined outside of the kernel). Each `path` can be a `beam` (i.e. `[beak spur]`) or just a `spur`, in which case the default `beak` (i.e. `[our %base now]`) will be prepended.

`ted/eval.hoon` expects the input to be a Hoon expression. It's very similar to `urbit eval`, except that it has access to ship state: `now`, `our`, vane & agent state, etc.

`ted/khan-eval.hoon` expects the input to be a thread. It attempts to compile the thread using the dependencies (if any) and then sends it to Khan as a `%lard` thread request.

Both threads return regular thread output, i.e. a `vase`.

Examples:
- `-eval '(add 2 2)'`
- `-eval '(my-add 2 2)' [/lib/my-add/hoon ~]`
    - Where `my-add` is defined in `lib/my-add.hoon` in `%base`
- `-eval '(my-add 2 2)' [/(scot %p our)/my-desk/(scot %da now)/lib/my-add/hoon ~]`
    - Where `my-add` is defined in `lib/my-add.hoon` in `%my-desk`
- `-khan-eval '=/  m  (strand ,vase)  ;<  ~  bind:m  (poke [~zod %hood] %helm-hi !>(\'\'))  (pure:m !>(\'success\'))'`

### click {#click}

[click](https://github.com/urbit/vere/blob/develop/bin/click) is a `bash` thin client which auto-formats `-eval` and `-khan-eval` thread calls via `%fyrd` requests to `conn.c` and coordinates chaining together the appropriate commands to execute those requests on a running ship.

Using click, a call like:
```
echo $'[0 %fyrd %base %khan-eval %noun %ted-eval \'=/  m  (strand ,vase)  ;<  ~  bind:m  (poke [~zod %hood] %helm-hi !>(\\\'\\\'))  (pure:m !>(\\\'success\\\'))\']' |
/path/to/urbit eval -jn |
nc -U -W 1 /path/to/zod/.urb/conn.sock |
/path/to/urbit eval -cn
```
instead looks like:
```
/path/to/click -k /path/to/zod $'=/  m  (strand ,vase)  ;<  ~  bind:m  (poke [~zod %hood] %helm-hi !>(\\\'\\\'))  (pure:m !>(\\\'success\\\'))'
```
or even more conveniently:
```
/path/to/click -k -i threads/poke.hoon /path/to/zod
```

```
Usage:
    click [options] <path-to-pier> <hoon> [<dependencies> ...]
    click [options] -i <path-to-file> <path-to-pier> [<dependencies> ...]
    click [-o|-p] -e -i <path-to-file> <path-to-pier>

    Thin client for interacting with running Urbit ship via conn.c

    options:
        -e                  Execute jammed Hoon
        -h                  Show usage info
        -i <path-to-file>   Read input from file
        -j                  Jam only
        -k                  Execute command using "khan-eval" thread
        -o <path-to-file>   Output to file
        -p                  Filter failure stack traces from result and pretty-print them to stderr
        -x                  Jam to hex
```

'/sur/hood/hoon'
```
### Additional Notes {#additional-notes}

#### Alternative click calls

Any example above that uses click has two additional options that have been omitted for brevity, since the actual code for the call would be identical in each example:

1. Custom `-thread` in `%desk`:
```
echo "[0 %fyrd %desk %thread %noun %noun ~]" |
/path/to/urbit eval -jn |
nc -U -W 1 /path/to/pier/zod/.urb/conn.sock |
/path/to/urbit eval -cn
```

2. Pass inline thread to click from file:
```
/path/to/bin/click -k -i path/to/thread.hoon /path/to/pier/zod
```

#### Undocked ships

click assumes that the ship at the given pier is docked (i.e. that `/path/to/pier/.run` exists). If for whatever reason the running ship is undocked, it's still possible to work around this assumption using the click-format helper script. For example, the call for `+vats` becomes:
```
/path/to/click-format -k \
$'=/  m  (strand ,vase)  ;<  our=@p  bind:m  get-our  ;<  now=@da  bind:m  get-time  (pure:m !>((crip ~(ram re [%rose [~ ~ ~] (report-vats our now)]))))' \
'/sur/hood/hoon' |
/path/to/urbit eval -jn |
nc -U -W 1 /path/to/pier/zod/.urb/conn.sock |
/path/to/urbit eval -ckn
```

## Issues and Future Work {#issues-and-future-work}

Currently, there are a number of minor issues and one major issue impacting interactions between Earth and Mars.

The minor issues are:
- `conn.c`'s simulated namespace for `%peel`
    - Unprincipled namespace simulation for no reason other than consistency with Arvo scry
- `/mass` path for `conn.c` `%peel` not implemented
- No `mass` mark in Arvo, so attempting to scry for `|mass` with `%peek` crashes the ship

The major issue is the lack of "thick" clients which are able to consume the newt-encoded jammed nouns emitted by `conn.c` as input. Though not officially codified yet, it makes sense for newt-encoded jammed nouns to be the [narrow waist](https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/02/diagrams.html) of Urbit, and [recent design decisions appear to be heading in this direction](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6396). Unfortunately, the narrow waist of `bash` is text, and it's not always easy or useful to convert nouns to text (particularly stack traces).

There exist already two external noun libraries, in [Rust](https://github.com/urbit/noun) and Haskell (link to Haskell lib coming soon). Adding more, while not trivial, is not difficult. The proliferation of noun representation libraries in other languages would open many doors with regards to the support, hosting, and application opportunities available (the ever-fabled "Quake over Urbit").
