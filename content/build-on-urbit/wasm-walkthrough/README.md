Urbit's WebAssembly affordances (collectively known as "UrWasm") enables Hoon developers to leverage pre-existing libraries from any Wasm-compatible language like Rust, Python, and Go.

These docs cover:

- [Example usage](./generator.md) of a Wasm module sort a large list.
- UrWasm data types and library [reference](./reference).
