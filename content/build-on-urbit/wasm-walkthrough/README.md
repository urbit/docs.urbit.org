# WASM Walkthrough

Urbit's WebAssembly affordances (collectively known as "UrWasm") enables Hoon developers to leverage pre-existing libraries from any WASM-compatible language like Rust, Python, and Go. Using QuickJS as a WASM module, they can also run Javascript on the Urbit ship.

These docs cover:
- UrWasm overview
- UrWasm examples
- UrWasm types and API
