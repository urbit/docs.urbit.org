# WebAssembly Walkthrough

Urbit's WebAssembly affordances (collectively known as "UrWasm") enables Hoon developers to leverage pre-existing libraries from any Wasm-compatible language like Rust, Python, and Go.

This section includes an [overview](./overview.md) of Wasm and how it can be run on Urbit. It also includes a trivial [example](./generator.md) of a Hoon generator using a Wasm module to sort a list.

For a thorough description of UrWasm's types and libraries, see the [`%base`](../../urbit-os/base/wasm/README.md) docs.
