If you like to learn at your own pace, there are in-depth
[tutorials](#tutorials) for learning the Hoon programming language and Urbit
app development. If you like a more hands-on approach, the Urbit Foundation
runs live, tutored cohort classes in [Urbit Academy](/courses/urbit-academy).

## Urbit Academy

The Urbit Foundation offers a variety of cohort courses for those interested in
learning development on Urbit. If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a
hands-on instructor, regular exercises and discussions, and a completion
certification, then these courses will be a good fit for you.
