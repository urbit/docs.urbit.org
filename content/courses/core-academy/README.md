# Core Academy

Core Academy prepares developers to become kernel developers. Although not relying on App Workshop, Core Academy participants should be capable of composing fairly complex applications in Hoon. C experience is also a prerequisite for the runtime material (Rust for Sword, n√©e Ares).

This written course is adapted from the teaching notes for the 2023 cohort of Core Academy, its first and to-date only cohort. The course explores each part of Arvo, Zuse, Hoon, and the runtime to contextualize how Urbit works today and where further development is needed. The lesson notes thus represent a snapshot of Urbit core development at Zuse 412k and Vere 2.12. Some details have changed since that release.

Video recordings of the 2023 Core Academy are [available to watch here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYGEMSwLguIGgrEGwxu2AAbESpfF_LRKx). The order in which vanes are covered differs between this written material and the recorded lectures, but aside from some Q&A in the lectures it's all the same information.

Preliminary material:

- [Hoon School, Text Parsing III](../hoon-school/Q2-parsing.md)
- [Hoon School, Generic and Variant Cores](../hoon-school/R-metals.md)
- [The Nested Cores Pattern](../../hoon/guides/engine-pattern.md)
