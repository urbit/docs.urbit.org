App Workshop is an ongoing hands-on intensive course to demonstrate
high-quality Urbit apps ready for end users.  It serves as a follow-on
to App Academy with more focus on building complex apps and exploring
application architecture on Urbit.

We offer about ten App Workshop classes per year, each on a different
topic.  Past topics have included:

- Urbit as a server
- Database structures and operations
- Building CLI apps
- Filesystem operations

By participating in App Workshop, you will prepare yourself to
produce sophisticated production-quality apps and app suites that
leverage Urbit's platform.
