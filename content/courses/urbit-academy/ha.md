Hoon Academy is the live, cohort based Hoon course offered by the Urbit Foundation. With a hands-on instructor, exercises and feedback, office hours and discussions, Hoon Academy will be the best way for most to get started as an Urbit developer.

Our next cohort starts on May 14, with classes running Tuesdays at 12pm noon for 9 weeks. Sessions will also be recorded, so you can enroll if you can't make it live.

The syllabus from our last offering [is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQL4B59B0uK75KFSErb-BFJ8pbhVxyoyA1tRiv4RBlc/edit?usp=sharing).

Hoon Academy graduates will be well-positioned to read and interpret most Hoon code, produce useful standalone code of their own, and start exploring the Urbit system for app development or core development.
