**Ames** is the name of the Urbit network and the [vane](vane.md) that communicates over it. It's an encrypted peer-to-peer network composed of instances of the [Arvo](arvo.md) operating system. Each point ([galaxy](galaxy.md), [star](star.md), [planet](planet.md), [moon](moon.md), or [comet](comet.md)) communicates over the network utilizing the Ames protocol.
