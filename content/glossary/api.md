# API

**API** stands for "application programming interface". It refers to the definitions and protocols that allow one application to communicate with another. In Urbit, some notable APIs are the `task`s and `gift`s of [vanes](vane.md) (kernel modules) and things like [pokes](poke.md) for [Gall](gall.md) [agents](agent.md).
