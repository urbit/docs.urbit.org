# Arm

An **arm** is a named Hoon expression in a [core](core.md). A core contains one or more arms. If a core is thought of as an object in an object-oriented language, its arms can be thought of as its methods.

Arms are one of the two types of [wing](wing.md) in the [subject](subject.md), the other being a [leg](leg.md).
