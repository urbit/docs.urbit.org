# Bunt

In [Hoon](hoon.md), **bunting** a [mold](mold.md) produces its default/example value (or "bunt value"). For example, the bunt of a null-terminated `list` is `~` (null, an empty list). The bunt of `@ud` (an unsigned decimal) is `0`. Bunting is done with the kettar [rune](rune.md) (`^*`), or more commonly its irregular form: a `*` prefix like `*@ud`, `*(list @t)`, etc.
