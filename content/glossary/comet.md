# Comet

A **comet** is a kind of [ship](ship.md) on the [Ames](ames.md) network which may be quickly generated by anyone and which are virtually unlimited. They have many uses, including but not limited to:
- free identities for new users to try things out before deciding to purchase a [planet](planet.md).
- bots
- remaining anonymous
- testing software

Comets have nearly all the same capabilities as a planet. The restrictions they do possess are technical constraints of the system due primarily to the fact that they have no presence on [Azimuth](azimuth.md), rather than purposefully placed blockades:

- They may not [change their networking keys](bridge.md).
- They may not spawn [moons](moon.md).
 
If you wish to change your networking keys, we suggest generating a new comet. Moons are impossible for comets due to the structure of the address space.

Some groups may also not allow comet membership.
