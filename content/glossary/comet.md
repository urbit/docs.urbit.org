A **comet** is a kind of [ship](/glossary/ship) on the [Ames](/glossary/ames) network which
may be quickly generated by anyone and which are virtually unlimited. They have
many uses, including but not limited to:
- free identities for new users to try things out before deciding to purchase a [planet](/glossary/planet).
- bots
- remaining anonymous
- testing software

Comets have nearly all the same capabilities as a planet. The restrictions they
do possess are technical constraints of the system due primarily to the fact
that they have no presence on [Azimuth](/glossary/azimuth), rather
than purposefully placed blockades:

- They may not [change their networking keys](/glossary/bridge).
- They may not spawn [moons](/glossary/moon).
 
If you wish to change your networking keys, we suggest generating a new comet.
Moons are impossible for comets due to the structure of the address space.

Some groups may also not allow comet membership.
