# Eyre

**Eyre** is the web-server [vane](vane.md) (kernel module) that handles client-facing HTTP operations. Unix sends HTTP messages though to Eyre and Eyre produces HTTP messages in response. It is the counterpart to [Iris](iris.md), which is the server-facing HTTP vane.

In general, apps and vanes do not call Eyre; rather, Eyre calls apps and vanes. Eyre uses [Gall](gall.md) to facilitate communication with apps.

Eyre is located at `/base/sys/vane/eyre.hoon` within [Arvo](arvo.md).
