# Gift

A `%gift` [card](card.md) is an effect produced by [agents](agent.md) and [threads](thread.md). It is a *response* to a request from another agent or [vane](vane.md), as opposed to a `%pass` card, which is a *request*. The main kind of gift is a [fact](fact.md), which is an update given to subscribers.
