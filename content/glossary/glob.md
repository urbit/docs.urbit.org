# Glob

A **glob** is a bundle of front-end resources for an app which is served to a web client by the `%docket` [agent](agent.md) in the [%landscape](landscape.md) [desk](desk.md). The glob will typically contain an `index.html` file, along with CSS, JS, and other resources the web app needs. The glob for an app will be retrieved when you install it, either over [Ames](ames.md) or from an external web server.
