# Kernel

The **kernel** is the core, fundamental components of an operating system. In the case of [Arvo](arvo.md), it is `arvo.hoon`, its [vanes](vane.md) (kernel modules), and associated libraries. The code for Arvo's kernel is located in the `/sys` directory of the `%base` [desk](desk.md). "Kernelspace" is contrasted with "userspace", which includes [agents](agent.md), [threads](thread.md), [generators](generator.md), front-end resources and other non-kernel files in [Clay](clay.md).
