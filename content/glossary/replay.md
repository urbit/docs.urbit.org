# Replay

**Replay** is how [Vere](vere.md) computes the state of a ship's [Arvo](arvo.md) instance from the [event log](eventlog.md) after a ship reboots. In order to avoid replaying the entire event log, Replay takes a snapshot of the current state of the ship approximately once every ten minutes. Then when a ship reboots, Replay loads the most recent snapshot and replays events from the event log up to the most recent event.
