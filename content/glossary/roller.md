# Roller

A **roller** is a service that can be run on a [ship](ship.md) that accepts [L2](rollups.md) [Azimuth](azimuth.md) transactions, bundles them together, and submits the batch to Azimuth on the Ethereum blockchain. Tlon runs the roller used by the default [Bridge](bridge.md) instance at [bridge.urbit.org](https://bridge.urbit.org), but anyone can run their own - especially if they want to submit large volumes of transactions.
