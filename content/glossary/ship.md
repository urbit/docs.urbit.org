# Ship

A **ship** is an instance of an Urbit computer that is a peer on the [Arvo](arvo.md) network.

A ship can be one of five classes:

* [comets](comet.md), disposable identities.
* [moons](moon.md), connected devices subordinated to a ship.
* [planets](planet.md), individual users.
* [stars](star.md), network infrastructure nodes.
* [galaxy](galaxy.md), also network infrastructure nodes.

To be able to use the Arvo network, planets, stars, and galaxies must be combined with an [Azimuth](azimuth.md)-based Urbit identity in the form of a [keyfile](keyfile.md).
