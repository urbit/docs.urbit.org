# String {#string}

**String** is the general programming term for a piece of text. In Hoon, there are two main kinds of strings: [cords](cord.md) and [tapes](tape.md). A `cord` (and its sub-sets `knot` and `term`) is UTF-8 text in a single [atom](atom.md). A `tape` is a [list](list.md) of single UTF-8 characters.
