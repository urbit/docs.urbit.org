# Subject Oriented Programming

The Urbit operating system hews to a conceptual model wherein each expression takes place in a certain [context](context.md) (the [subject](subject.md)). While sharing a lot of practicality with other programming paradigms and platforms, Urbit's model is mathematically well-defined and unambiguously specified. Every expression of [Hoon](hoon.md) is evaluated relative to its subject, a piece of data that represents the environment, or the context, of an expression.
