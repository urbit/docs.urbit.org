# Thread

A **thread** is like a transient [Gall](gall.md) [agent](agent.md). Unlike an agent, it can end and it can fail. The primary uses for threads are:

1. Complex IO, like making a bunch of external API calls where each call depends on the last. Doing this in an agent significantly increases its complexity and the risk of a mishandled intermediary state corrupting permanent state. If you spin the IO out into a thread, your agent only has to make one call to the thread and receive one response.
2. Testing - threads are very useful for writing complex tests for your agents.

[Spider](spider.md) is the [Gall](gall.md)
[agent](agent.md) that manages
[threads](thread.md).
