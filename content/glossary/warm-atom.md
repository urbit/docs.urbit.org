# Warm atom

A **warm atom** is an [atom](atom.md) with an ordinary [aura](aura.md). The type of a warm atom is, conceptually, the set of all possible values for that aura. For example, the [cord](cord.md) `'foo'` nests under the type of the cord `'bar'` - they both have `@t` auras. This is in contrast to a [cold atom](cold-atom.md), where its type is an exact value.
