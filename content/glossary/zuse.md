# Zuse

**Zuse** is a utility library included with the [kernel](kernel.md) at `/sys/zuse.hoon` in the `%base` [desk](zuse.md). Zuse contains a large number of useful functions, most prominently those relating to cryptography and HTML/JSON parsing/printing.

Zuse is the farthest downstream component of the kernel in terms of dependency, so its version number is used to represent the version of the kernel as a whole.
