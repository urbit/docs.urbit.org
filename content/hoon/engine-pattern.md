# The Engine Pattern

*The following is lightly adapted from "The Nested Core Design Pattern (As Seen Through `+abet`)", a 2022 blog post by \~lagrev-nocfep, which was written in collaboration with \~rovnys-ricfer.*

*They discuss the engine pattern in detail in this video which accompanied the blog post.*

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/T4VyW72zX0w" %}

The core is one of the key elements of Urbit's subject-oriented programming paradigm. As a way of organizing code and data in a homoiconic language, the core pattern allows Hoon developers to encapsulate processes and lexically scope code while relying on a well-structured fundament. Simple core patterns like gates and traps have only one arm in their battery and possibly no sample at all (for a trap). More complex core patterns (such as the `|^` barket core, and doors) can consist of inner cores and outer cores, as well as stacking samples (such as for a gate in a door).

This pattern can telescope beyond doors, however, into the "engine pattern". (Also known as the "nested core" pattern.) In this guide, we examine the engine pattern through its most common instantiation, the `+abet` pattern.

The basic engine pattern uses an auxiliary core to manage building state changes. As a core contains `[battery payload]`, code and data, we can recursively place cores into the payload of a core. By carefully maintaining encapsulated state (i.e. state that doesn't leak, state that is enclosed by its core), we can build a pattern of stacked cores that maintain their own mutable state locally. That is, the inner core becomes a sort of “scripting language” for the outer core, wherein local mutable state is finalized and propagated back to the outer core using the `+abet` arm. 

Even a gate in a core is actually a stacked core in this sense: it stacks a sample and `$` arm onto the core stack which formed its subject.

By convention, an `+abed` arm (if any) provides initialization and an `+abet` arm finalizes the changes and hands back the mutated state. A number of other semi-standard arms are employed to manage particular state changes. Arms in a core are conventionally prefixed with two letters corresponding to that core, because engines can nest inside of each other.

Thus, a very simple engine core could look like this, from an old version of the `%groups` desk:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
++  ca-core
  |_  [=flag:c =chat:c gone=_|]
  ++  ca-core  .
  ++  ca-abet
    %_  cor
        chats
      ?:  gone
        (~(del by chats) flag)
      (~(put by chats) flag chat)
    ==
  ++  ca-abed
    |=  f=flag:c
    ca-core(flag f, chat (~(got by chats) f))
  ::  ...
  --
```

{% endcode %}

In this door, the second `+ca-core` line refers to the door itself: in this case, to a particular chat in the agent's `chats` map. `+ca-abed` is an initializer which creates `+ca-core`'s sample by retrieving the data for this `$chat` from `chats`. `+ca-abet` is used to create a mutated `chats` map, with this `$chat` added or removed. `cor` is an alias for a helper core, elsewhere in the file, containing `+ca-core`. In this case `$flag` is not a loobean `?`, but an id for a particular chat.

An instance of using this door could look like this:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
=/  chat-core  (ca-abed:ca-core p.action)
?:  =(p.p.action our.bowl)
  ca-abet:(ca-update:chat-core q.action)
ca-abet:(ca-proxy:chat-core q.action)
```

{% endcode %}

This code employs the `+ca-abet` arm to handle cards. The `+ca-core` accumulates cards, then yields them all at once for evaluation.

## Two Styles of Engine Design {#two-styles-of-engine-design}

Once you are comfortable thinking in terms of cores and doors, the engine pattern is a natural evolution to a more abstract and powerful viewpoint. Just as a door generalizes certain aspects of a gate to a more general usage, the engine pattern serves to generalize the door by effectively providing a higher-level script for operations.

Cores can be nested inside of each other to manage state changes concisely. An inner core can act like a higher-level script or domain-specific language for the outer core it serves.

One of the challenges of teaching the engine pattern for the first time is that it's a [_design pattern_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern), not a particular instance of code. Thus there is a fair amount of variation in implementation for solving particular problems.

There are, however, two basic archetypes for building engines:
- "Ames-style" cores which only modify one key-value pair in a map and emit a list of effects.
- "Clay-style" cores which focus on modifying one part of a map, but may make other changes as well.

### Ames {#ames}

In `/sys/vane/ames.hoon`, we find these definitions:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
++  event-core  .
++  abet  [(flop moves) ames-state]
++  emit  |=(=move event-core(moves [move moves]))
```

{% endcode %}

Using the engine pattern in Ames usually involves building a list of `$move`s and then pulling them back out:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
  ::  if processing succeeded, send positive ack packet and exit
  ++  send-ack
    |=  =bone
    ^+  event-core
    =/  cork=?  (~(has in closing.peer-state) bone)
    abet:(run-message-sink:peer-core bone %done ok=%.y cork)
```

{% endcode %}

Note that in this case, the `+abet` arm is not just returning some mutated state, but also a list of `$move`s.

You can see the Ames-style pattern illustrated today in many core apps, such as `/app/acme.hoon` which obtains HTTPS letsencrypt certificates.

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
::  +abet: finalize transaction
::
++  abet
  ^-  (quip card _state)
  [(flop cards) state]
```

{% endcode %}

Various arms in `%acme` like `+wake` make calls such as `%-  (slog u.error)  abet` from time to time.

### Clay {#clay}

In `/sys/vane/clay.hoon`, we find a more complicated `+abet`:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
++  abet
  ^-  [(list move) raft]
  :-  (flop mow)
  ?.  =(our her)
    =/  run  (~(gut by hoy.ruf) her *rung)
    =/  rug  (~(put by rus.run) syd red)
    ruf(hoy (~(put by hoy.ruf) her run(rus rug)))
```

{% endcode %}

We don't need to worry about inner details of Clay to see that there's more going on here: several internal maps are updated as part of one state change, separately from the list of `$move`s being accrued to `mow` list.

The engine pattern is used elsewhere, notably in Gall and in `%hood`, but in Ames and Clay we see the two basic patterns.

### Gall {#gall}

Gall uses two engines to manage agents: `+mo` handles Arvo-level `$move`s, while `+ap` acts as the “agent engine”. While there are many elements to each, here is a partial glimpse of how `+mo` structures its approach. (There are many other arms to build particular cards or produce state changes.)

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
::
++  mo-core  .
::  +mo-abed: initialize state with the provided duct
++  mo-abed
  |=(hun=duct mo-core(hen hun))
::  +mo-abet: finalize, reversing moves
++  mo-abet
  [(flop moves) gall-payload]
::  +mo-give: prepend a standard %give to the current list of moves
++  mo-give
  |=(g=gift mo-core(moves [[hen give+g] moves]))
::  +mo-pass: prepend a standard %pass to the current list of moves
++  mo-pass
  |=(p=[wire note-arvo] mo-core(moves [[hen pass+p] moves]))
::  +mo-slip: prepend a %slip move to the current list of moves
++  mo-slip
  |=(p=note-arvo mo-core(moves [[hen slip+p] moves]))
::  +mo-past: prepend several %pass moves to the current list of moves
++  mo-past
  |=(=(list [wire note-arvo]) ?~(list mo-core =.(mo-core (mo-pass i.list) $(list t.list))))
::  +mo-jolt: (re)start agent if not already started on this desk
++  mo-jolt
  |=([dap=term =ship =desk] (mo-boot dap ship desk))
```

{% endcode %}

Some of these are “standard” `+abet` pattern arms, while others are particular to `+mo`.

### Behn {#behn}

Behn exemplifies a clear and simple usage of the `+abet` pattern with stacked cores, but as a centralized state machine.

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
|%
++  per-event
  =|  moves=(list move)
  |=  [[now=@da =duct] state=behn-state]
  |%
  ++  this  .
  ++  emit  |=(m=move this(moves [m moves]))
  ++  abet
    ^+  [moves state]
    ::  moves are statefully pre-flopped to ensure that
    ::  any prepended %doze is emitted first
    ::
    =.  moves  (flop moves)
    =/  new=(unit @da)
      (bind (pry:timer-map timers.state) head)
    ::  emit %doze if needed
    ::
    =?    ..this
        ?~  unix-duct.state  |
        =/  dif=[old=(unit @da) new=(unit @da)]
          [next-wake.state new]
        ?+  dif  ~|([%unpossible dif] !!)
          [~ ~]  |                        :: no-op
          [~ ^]  &                        :: set
          [^ ~]  &                        :: clear
          [^ ^]  !=(u.old.dif u.new.dif)  :: set if changed
        ==
      %-  emit(next-wake.state new)
      [unix-duct.state %give %doze new]
    ::
    [moves state]
:: * * *
--
```

{% endcode %}

The `+per-event` core is used to script the neighboring `+scry` and `+call` arms for the vane without leaking state invariants. Behn's instantiation of the `+abet` pattern centralizes what we've elsewhere called the “inner core” as a centralized state machine.

### Generalizing the `+abet` Pattern {#generalizing-the-abet-pattern}

As mentioned, the engine pattern is a pattern rather than a particular example of code. The tell-tale mark of `+abet`-style engine pattern code, above all else, is a core containing an `+abet` finalizer arm.

Here are some common `+abet` pattern arms. These are not all unique, and many cores will omit all or most of these.

- `+abed`: Initialize. Set up the state of the inner core.
- `+yoke`: Initialize. Start from a particular value.
- `+abet`: Finalize. Exit from an inner core to an outer core, taking changes. Commonly, take a modified valued and overwrite it into the final state with a `+put:by`.
- `+abut`: Finalize. Alternative exit from `+abet` for a deletion.
- `+move`: Send a move. Generalization for `+pass`/`+give`.
- `+pass`: Request an action. Prepend a `%pass` move to the current list of moves.
- `+give`: Return a result. Prepend a standard `%give` to the current list of moves.
- `+emit`: Submit a card. Prepend a card to the current list of cards.
- `+emil`: Submit cards. Prepend a list of cards to the current list of cards.

We recommend reading the following examples which employ the engine pattern:

- `+mo` in `%base`'s `/sys/gall.hoon`
- `+ap` in `%base`'s `/sys/gall.hoon`
- `+vats` in `%base`'s `/lib/hood/kiln.hoon`
- `+go` in [`%cult`](https://github.com/rabsef-bicrym/cult/blob/master/gora/cult/cult.hoon)'s `/cult/cult.hoon`

For instance, [Quartus’ Cult library](https://github.com/rabsef-bicrym/cult/blob/master/gora/cult/cult.hoon) uses the engine pattern in `+go` for a [gossip protocol library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol). Some of the names are different (e.g. `+easy` for `+abed`), but you can see how the design pattern holds:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
::  +go-emit - add card to cards
::  +go-emil - add list of cards
::  +go-abet - and state changes
::  +go-dick - inspect the group
::  +go-form - maybe form a cult
::  +go-diff - handle easy diffs
::  +go-easy - start cult engine
```

{% endcode %}


##  Nested Core Patterns {#nested-core-patterns}

To recap at this point: the engine pattern represents a way of using a helper core to manage complicated state changes, and thus encapsulate code away from standard patterns such as the ten-armed Gall agent. It's useful to think of the inner core as being like a [cursor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)), a local focus of attention to build a particular effect.

How could you use the engine pattern today?  A Gall agent is a door with a sample of the `$bowl` and an associated state. `$card`s are issued from the agent to Arvo and other agents, while gifts and incoming `$card`s are handled by the agent. This means that agents need to compose lists of `$card`s: the ubiquitous `(quip card _this)` return type. This pair of `(list card)` and `$agent:gall` allow us to produce effects (`$card`s) and return new state.

A Gall agent sometimes needs to issue a lot of state changes using `$card`s. This can lead to awkward chains of [`=^` tisket](rune/tis.md#tisket) pins as several cards are aggregated together before resolving. (`$card`s are all executed “at the same time”, meaning before any mutations are applied to the state, but composing several `$card`s together can be vexing.)

As an alternative, a helper core (the inner core, engine, or cursor) can be used to encapsulate complex card handling. When used well, the engine pattern can lead to cleaner code factoring and sequestration of more complex logic.

By convention, these helper cores are included in the same file as the Gall agent (rather than a `/lib` file) because they frequently need to access agent state. But as with `/lib/hood/kiln.hoon`, there are elegant ways to avoid this necessity.

Other arms, such as `+set-timer`, then simply construct cards which are inserted into the `+abet` core's list.

### List pattern {#list-pattern}

For instance, imagine a chat app. When a message arrives, a card can be built on the basis of what changes need to be effected: subscribers need to be notified with a `%gift`.

Classically, a single card would be bundled with any necessary state changes:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
:_  this(messages ~[new-message messages])
:~  :*  %give  %fact
        ~[/update]
        %chat-effect
        !>  ^-  chat-effect
        new-message
    ==
==
```

{% endcode %}

Much like a single card, a list of cards can be produced and returned from an arm in a Gall agent. Here a Gall agent triggers a thread:

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
:_  this
:~  :*  %pass   wire
        %agent  [our.bowl %spider]
        %watch  /thread-result/[tid]
    ==
    :*  %pass   wire
        %agent  [our.bowl %spider]
        %poke   %spider-start  !>(args)
    ==
==
```

{% endcode %}

This pattern works well for single cards or short collections of them, in particular with simple generating logic.

### `=^` tisket pattern {#tisket-pattern}

The classic way of composing several cards uses a [`=^` tisket](rune/tis.md#tisket) to pin a state and a helper core to process actions. This allows sequestration of logic into particular arms.

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
=^    cards
    state
  `state(allowances (~(put by allowances) +.action))
[cards this]
```

{% endcode %}

Another advantage (at the cost of more obfuscatory logic) is that code effects can be better ordered, e.g. in this code snippet which registers a token (`+register-api-key`) before using the corresponding token (`+employ-api-key`).

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
=^    cards
    state
  (register-api-key:main source.action target.action)
=^    cards
    state
  (employ-api-key:main source.action target.action)
:_  state
^-  (list card)
%+  weld
  cards
%+  give-simple-payload:app:server
  id
(handle-api-request:main source target)
```

{% endcode %}

### `+abet` pattern {#abet-pattern}

Given a nested core, rather than simply produce `(quip card _this)`, you can close over a list of cards and state using a core, then pull the `+abet` arm on that core to produce the new list of cards and state.

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
++  abet
  ^-  (quip card _state)
  [(flop cards) state]
```

{% endcode %}

You've seen the basic engine pattern above. For the case of a chat app with engines, let's circle back around to `%groups`.

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
|_  [=bowl:gall cards=(list card)]
  ++  abet  [(flop cards) state]
  ++  cor   .
  ++  emit
    |=(=card cor(cards [card cards]))
  ++  emil
    |=(caz=(list card) cor(cards (welp (flop caz) cards)))
  ++  give
    |=(=gift:agent:gall (emit %give gift))
  ++  now-id   `id:c`[our now]:bowl
  ::  ...
  ++  poke
    |=  [=mark =vase]
    |^  ^+  cor
    ?+    mark  ~|(bad-poke/mark !!)
    ::  ...
    ::
        %chat-leave
      =+  !<(=leave:c vase)
      ?<  =(our.bowl p.leave)  :: cannot leave chat we host
      ca-abet:ca-leave:(ca-abed:ca-core leave)
    ::
        %chat-action
      =+  !<(=action:c vase)
      =.  p.q.action  now.bowl
      =/  chat-core  (ca-abed:ca-core p.action)
      ?:  =(p.p.action our.bowl)
        ca-abet:(ca-update:chat-core q.action)
      ca-abet:(ca-proxy:chat-core q.action)
    ::
        %dm-action
      =+  !<(=action:dm:c vase)
      di-abet:(di-proxy:(di-abed-soft:di-core p.action) q.action)
    ::  ...
    ==
```

{% endcode %}

The basic idea, once again, is to create an ephemeral inner core to script the outer core, with the inner core containing its own local mutable state. The inner core itself is never included in the result of running any arms of the outer core, and is only instantiated by calls to the outer core's arms. Effectively, the inner core is private, in the object-oriented programming sense.

Several interesting features are legible here even without examining the engines separately:

1. You can see there is a `+ca` core for chats and a `+di` core for direct messages.
2. There is no `+abed` arm in place here since this core doesn't carry any state it needs to initialize.
3. `+emit`/`+emil`/`+give` handle contributed moves.

The `+abet` pattern itself is rather simple to construct in userspace, and exemplifies the utility of engines. By sequestering logic, it yields cleaner agent code. It also enables other arms to construct a list of cards rather than having to produce chained `=^`-style constructions.

### Stacked Core Pattern {#stacked-core-pattern}

We use the terminology of "engine pattern" to refer to the case where an inner core and an outer core have a slot for mutable state between them.

"Stacked core pattern" is a more general case which may not have a slot for mutable state (such as a gate in a `|%` barcen core). The “`+abet` pattern” refers to a particular special case of the engine pattern.

Another common stacked core pattern, `+get:by`, is a closure, wherein the `+by` core has “closed around” the map treap, and the `+get:by` gate closes around the entire `+by` core by adding a sample and `$` arm. In this case, the inner core doesn't have its own mutable state separate from the outer core, so it's not an `+abet` pattern or a engine pattern, but a stacked core pattern.

{% code wrap="nowrap" %}

```hoon
++  by                                                  ::  map engine
  ~/  %by
  =|  a=(tree (pair))  ::  (map)
  |@
  ++  get                                               ::  grab value by key
    ~/  %get
    |*  b=*
    =>  .(b `_?>(?=(^ a) p.n.a)`b)
    |-  ^-  (unit _?>(?=(^ a) q.n.a))
    ?~  a
      ~
    ?:  =(b p.n.a)
      (some q.n.a)
    ?:  (gor b p.n.a)
      $(a l.a)
    $(a r.a)
  --
```

{% endcode %}

Stacked cores can also be used to construct a stateless library as a sequence of `|%` barcen cores.
