# Emirp

## Challenge: Reversible Primes {#challenge-reversible-primes}

A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself, for example, `7`. An [emirp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirp) is a prime number that results in a different prime when its decimal digits are reversed. For example, `107` and `701` are a pair of emirps, and `3,049` and `9,403`.

Palindromic numbers are not emirps. `101` is a prime and its reverse is itself -- it is not an emirp.

Your task for this challenge is write a generator that will add up all the first *n* emirps. To be precise, you should write a generator `emirp` which takes a `@ud` number *n* as an input, and returns a `@ud` number which is the sum of the first *n* emirps.

Example usage:
```
> +emirp 10
638
```

The first 10 emirps are `13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 107, 113`, and their sum is `638`.

### Solution #2 {#solution-2}
_By ~ramteb-tinmut. Well-commented, easy to read, and fast._

```hoon
::  emirp.hoon
:: Return the sum of the first n emirp numbers
::
|=  target=@ud
=/  emirp-candidate  13  :: starting at the first emirp makes sense
=|  emirps=(list @ud)

|%
++  sieve
  :: When the target is reached, sum the list of emirps
  ::
  ?:  =(target (lent emirps))
    |-
    ?~  emirps
      0
    (add i.emirps $(emirps t.emirps))
  :: Whilst below target, recurse on is-emirp after incrementing
  :: 
  %=  sieve
    emirps  (is-emirp emirp-candidate)
    emirp-candidate  (add emirp-candidate 1)
  ==
++  is-emirp
  |=  candidate=@ud
  =/  reversed  (reverse-ud candidate)
  :: Check if candidate number is a palindrome
  ::
  ?:  !=(reversed candidate)
    :: Is it also a prime?
    ::
    ?:  (is-prime [candidate (sqt candidate)])
      :: Check if the reverse is also a prime:
      ::
      ?:  (is-prime [reversed (sqt reversed)])
        :: Success! - store the emirp
        ::
        (into emirps 1 candidate)
      :: The reverse is not a prime:
      ::
      emirps
    :: Not prime
    ::
    emirps
  :: Palindrome & invalid
  ::  
  emirps
++  is-prime
  =/  divisor  2
  |=  [candidate=@ud root=[@ @]]  
  
  :: Fastest check first - has the divisor reached our input candidate? 
  ::
  ?:  =(candidate divisor)
    %.y
  :: Ensure non-zero modulo
  ::
  ?:  =((mod candidate divisor) 0)
    %.n
  :: If not a prime, then number must have a divisor less than or equal to its square root. There's an edge case if the square root is not a whole number, in which case we need to round up:
  ::
  ?:  &(=(+3.root 0) (gth divisor +2.root))
    %.y
  ?:  (gth divisor (add 1 +2.root))
    %.y
  :: Increment divisor and repeat
  ::

    divisor  (add divisor 1)
  ==

++  reverse-ud
  |=  number=@ud
  ^-  @ud
  =/  reversed  0
  :: Return reversed @ud when number reaches zero
  ::
  |-
    ?:  =(0 number)  
      reversed
    :: Otherwise loop until all digits are swapped:
    ::
    =.  reversed  (add (mul 10 reversed) (mod number 10))
    $(number (div number 10))

## Unit Tests {#unit-tests}

Following a principle of test-driven development, the unit tests below allow us to check for expected behavior. To run the tests yourself, follow the instructions in the [Unit Tests](../../build-on-urbit/userspace/unit-tests.md) section.

```hoon
/+  *test
/=  emirp  /gen/emirp
|%
++  test-01
  %+  expect-eq
    !>  `@ud`13
    !>  (emirp 1)
++  test-02
  %+  expect-eq
    !>  `@ud`30
    !>  (emirp 2)
