# Water Towers

## Challenge: Water between Towers {#challenge-water-between-towers}

In a two-dimensional world, we begin with a bar-chart, or rows of unit-width 'towers' of arbitrary height. Then it rains, completely filling all convex enclosures in the chart with water.

```
9        █       
8        █           
7   █    █          
6   █ █  █           
5 █ █ █ ██      
4 █ █ ████      
3 ███ ████     
2 ████████ █ 
1 ██████████ 
```
```

```

Your task for this challenge is to write a generator `water-towers`. It will take as input a `(list @ud)`, with each number representing the height of a tower from left to right. It will output a `@ud` representing the units of water that can be contained within the structure.

Example usage:
```
> +water-towers [5 3 7 2 6 4 5 9 1 2 ~]
14
```

## Unit Tests {#unit-tests}

Following a principle of test-driven development, we compose a series of tests which allow us to rigorously check for expected behavior.

::
::  A gate for computing volume of water collected between towers.
::
::    Take a list (of type list @ud), with each value representing the height of
::    a tower from left to right. Outputs a @ud representing the units of water 
::    that can be contained within the structure.
::
::    Our approach involves calculating the total volume of rainfall or water by
::    aggregating the water volume from each tower location. For a specific 
::    tower location. water volume is determined by subtracting the “height” 
::    of the tower with maximum rainfall (“total height with water”) from the 
::    height of the tower alone. Tower heights are given by corresponding values
::    in the input list.
::  
::    The “total height with water” at a location is determined by the height of
::    surrounding boundary towers within our structure. Each tower location will
::    have at most two boundary towers: one boundary tower on either side (left 
::    and right). The left boundary tower is defined as the highest tower to the
::    left of our specified tower location. The right boundary tower is defined 
::    as the highest tower to the right of our specified tower location. The 
::    value of “total height with water” at a location is equal to the lesser of
::    the two boundary tower heights (the minimum of the left boundary tower 
::    height vs. right boundary tower height). When less than two boundary 
::    towers are present, the “total height with water” is equal to the height
::    of the tower itself because no water can be contained without boundaries.

::  index/location.
::
::    “Total height with water” at a particular location is measured using the 
::    heights (value) at the left and right boundary towers. The lesser of these
::    two values (left height vs right height) is equal to the “total height 
::    with water” at our input location. 
::  
::    Right boundary tower is the tallest tower to the right of the location--
::    i.e. highest value (height) with higher index. The left boundary tower is
::    the tallest tower to the left of the location i.e. highest value (height) 
::    with lower index. 
::
::    The “find-boundaryheight” arm iterates left to right and works for 
::    measuring height of the right boundary tower. For the left boundary tower 
::    we can use a mirror approach. We reverse the input list and adjust the 
::    input index accordinglyto move right-to-left. 
::
::    In the case where no right or left boundary tower exists, our 
::    “find-boundaryheight” arm will return the tower height at our current
