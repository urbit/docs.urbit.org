# Wings

`[%wing p=(list limb)]`

A wing is a limb search path into the subject.

## Produces {#produces}

A wing is a list of limbs (including a trivial list of one limb).  The limbs are resolved in succession.  The result of the last limb resolution is the value produced by the wing expression.

## Syntax {#syntax}

Irregular: `a.b.c`.  Read this as '`a` in `b` in `c`'. Finds limb `a` within limb `b` within limb `c` of the subject.

## Discussion {#discussion}

Intuitively, Hoon wings are written in the opposite order from attribute dot-paths in most languages.  Hoon `a.b.c` is Java's `c.b.a`; it means "a within b within c."

Any item in the wing can resolve to a leg (fragment) or arm (computation).  But if a non-terminal item in the wing would resolve to an arm, it resolves instead to the subject of the arm -- in other words, the core exporting that name.

The mysterious idiom `..b` produces the leg `b` if `b` is a leg; the core exporting `b` if `b` is an arm.  Since `.` is the same limb as `+`, `..b` is the same wing as `+1.foo`.

## Examples {#examples}

```
~zod:dojo> =a [fod=3 bat=[baz=1 moo=2]]

~zod:dojo> bat.a
[baz=1 moo=2]

~zod:dojo> moo.bat.a
2
```

## Wing Resolution {#wing-resolution}

There are two common syntaxes used to resolve a wing path into the current subject:  `.` dot and `:` col.

- `.` dot syntax, as `c.b.a`, resolves the wing path into the subject at the right hand using Nock 0 (or possibly Nock 9 or Nock 10 depending on the expression).
    
    ```hoon
    > !,(*hoon c.b.a)
    [%wing p=~[%c %b %a]]
    ```

- The `:` col operator expands to a `=>` tisgar to resolve the wing path against its right-hand side as the subject.  This can be a Nock 7 or possibly optimized by the compiler to a Nock 0.
    
    ```hoon
    > !,(*hoon c:b:a)
    [%tsgl p=[%wing p=~[%c]] q=[%tsgl p=[%wing p=~[%b]] q=[%wing p=~[%a]]]]
    ```
