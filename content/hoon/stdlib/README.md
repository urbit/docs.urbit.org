# Standard Library

Comprehensive documentation for the Hoon standard library.

The Hoon standard library provides a complete suite of functions for working with the fundamental data types and operations in Hoon. These functions are organized into numbered sections based on their purpose and the types they operate on. The numbering corresponds to the layer structure in `/sys/hoon.hoon`.

## Layer 1: Basic Operations {#layer-1-basic-operations}
- [1a: Basic Arithmetic](./1a.md) - Unsigned arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison functions.
- [1b: Tree Addressing](./1b.md) - Functions for addressing and navigating tree structures using Nock's tree addressing scheme.
- [1c: Containers](./1c.md) - Fundamental container types and molds including `+pair`, `+list`, `+unit`, `+tree`, `+gate`, and other essential type definitions.

## Layer 2: Data Structures and Operations {#layer-2-data-structures-and-operations}

### Unit and List Operations {#unit-and-list-operations}
- [2a: Unit Logic](./2a.md) - Functions for working with units (optional values).
