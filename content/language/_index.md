This section of the docs contains guides, examples and reference material for
Urbit's two languages: Nock and Hoon. Nock is like Urbit's assembly language; a
low-level function programming language that is interpreted by the runtime.
Hoon is the language apps and the kernel are written in. Hoon compiles to Nock.
