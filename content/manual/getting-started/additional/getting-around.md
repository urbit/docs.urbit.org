# Getting Around

### 1. Get oriented {#1-get-oriented}

After you've logged into your Urbit for the first time, you'll have an interface called Landscape – a way interact with the network and applications.  You'll also see a few pre-installed applications: Terminal, Groups, and Talk. More on them in a moment.

Above those are buttons to view System Preferences and check out notifications for messages and application activity. The search bar helps you surface applications you already have installed, or discover developers and applications across the Urbit network.

You'll likely want to focus on finding and joining new communities, which you can do with the **Groups** app.

### 2. Join a few groups {#2-join-a-few-groups}

Joining public groups is simple – just search for the group host's Urbit ID, and click join. Check out a walk-through of this process in the [Joining groups](joining-groups.md) guide.

### 3. Install some applications {#3-install-some-applications}

Groups are great, but Urbit goes way deeper with apps that are developed specifically for Urbit and use P2P networking for everything.

Check out the [Installing apps](installing-applications.md) guide for a walk-through on the process of installing Urbit applications.

### 4.  Explore interfaces {#4-explore-interfaces}

The default Urbit experience is using Landscape in the browser, but Urbit is also available on native mobile and desktop applications through alternative interfaces.  [Learn more about Urbit interfaces](interfaces.md).

### 5. Getting help {#5-getting-help}

If you need help getting around Urbit, the best place to go is the unofficial Urbit community: `~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community`. Those in the Help channel are willing to troubleshoot or provide links to resources to help you get out of a jam.  Note that Urbit Community can take a long time to join due to its size.

If you're having trouble with your planet or the hosting provider that's running your ship, try their support, as they'll have more context and resources to help solve your issue.  And you can always email support@urbit.org if you're having trouble getting onto the network.
