Installing Urbit applications is simple. Search for the developer and download the application directly from them.  We'll walk you through it.

### 1. Finding applications

To install an application, you'll need to know the ship it is distributed from, which is often its developer's Urbit ID, *e.g.* `~paldev` or `~dister-fabnev-hinmur`. If you know the application, you can enter the full shortcode, e.g. `~paldev/pals`. 

You can find a [public directory of applications](/ecosystem?type=applications) in the Ecosystem section of urbit.org.

Not all applications are listed on urbit.org, so you’ll discover more by actively using Urbit and meeting people.

However, we can get started by using a simple app from Urbit developer [`~paldev`](/ids/~paldev).

### 2. Search for a Developer

Once you’re on the network, you’ll see a large tiled interface with a few applications and a search bar on the top of the page.

Click and the search bar and search for the software provider’s Urbit ID.

For example, to install the pals application, search for `~paldev` and then click on the result for `~paldev` to show the applications.

### 3. Get the Application

Select the pals app, and a modal window will open that shows some information about the application. Go ahead and click the “Get App” button, and confirm the following modal window to begin the installation process.
