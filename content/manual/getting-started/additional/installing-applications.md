# Installing apps

Installing Urbit applications is simple. Search for the developer and download the application directly from them.  We'll walk you through it.

### 1. Finding applications {#1-finding-applications}

To install an application, you'll need to know the ship it is distributed from, which is often its developer's Urbit ID, *e.g.* \~paldev or \~dister-fabnev-hinmur. If you know the application's name and the developer's Urbit ID, you can enter the full shortcode, e.g. \~paldev/pals. 

### 2. Search for a Developer {#2-search-for-a-developer}

If you want to find applications without knowing the shortcode, check the "Get Urbit Apps" menu in the Landscape grid, the tiled interface you see when you open Urbit.

Click and the search bar and search for the software provider’s Urbit ID.

For example, to install the pals application, search for \~paldev and then click on the result for \~paldev to show the applications.
