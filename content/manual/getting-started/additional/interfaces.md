# Interfaces

Urbit ships by default with Landscape by [Tlon](https://tlon.io), a web-based interface for managing your ship and the software installed on it. While this offers a seamless way to launch Urbit apps from your browser, there are several other methods to interact with your Urbit. For example, [Scene](https://tirrel.io/scene/index.html) and [Realm](https://www.holium.com/) offer native desktop window managers for your Urbit. Additionally, developers can utilize the [Dojo](https://developers.urbit.org/overview/dojo) CLI interface for a more hands-on approach.
