# Self-hosting

To run Urbit on your own you need to be comfortable using a command line interface (CLI), and should have a basic understanding of how to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

Urbit OS is comprised of a virtual operating system (Arvo) and a runtime called (Vere). The runtime has official versions targeting Linux and macOS, although workarounds exist for Windows.

Running Urbit locally is good for experimentation, but in the long term you'll want to run it as a server — always on and accessible from anywhere. The nice thing about Urbit is that's easy to start local, and later move to cloud hosting or a home server. Or you can start with the latter options.

**Remember, never run your Urbit in more than one place!** Doing so will necessitate a [factory reset](https://operators.urbit.org/manual/id/guide-to-resets).
