To run Urbit on your own you need to be comfortable using a command line
interface (CLI), and should have a basic understanding of how to interact with
the Ethereum blockchain.

Urbit OS is comprised of a virtual operating system (Arvo) and a runtime called
(Vere). The runtime has official versions targeting Linux and macOS, although
workarounds exist for Windows.

Running Urbit locally is good for experimentation, but in the long term you'll
want to run it as a server — always on and accessible from anywhere. The nice
thing about Urbit is that's easy to start local, and later move to cloud hosting
or a home server. Or you can start with the latter options.

**Remember, never run your Urbit in more than one place!** Doing so will necessitate
a [factory reset](https://operators.urbit.org/manual/id/guide-to-resets).
