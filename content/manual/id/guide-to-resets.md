An important concept on the [Ames](https://developers.urbit.org/system/kernel/ames) network is that of
continuity. Continuity refers to how ships remember the order of their own
network messages and the network messages of others -- these messages are
numbered, starting from zero. A _factory reset_ is when ships on the network agree to
forget about this sequence and treat one or more ships like they are brand new.

## Factory Resets

Ships on the Ames network sometimes need to reset their continuity. A factory
reset (hereafter just called a _reset_) is
when an individual ship announces to the network: "I forgot who I am, let's
start over from scratch." That is, it clears its own event log and sends an
announcement to the network, asking all ships that have communicated with it to
reset its networking information in their state. This makes it as though the
ship was just started for the first time again, since everyone on the network
has forgotten about it.

Resets often fix connectivity issues, but should only be used as a last
resort. Before performing a reset, look at alternative fixes in the [Ship
Troubleshooting](/manual/os/ship-troubleshooting) guide. Also reach out for help
in the Help channel in the Urbit Community group
`~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community` to see if there is another option. Connectivity
issues are typically related to a bug, and you may be able to help us fix it by
emailing us at `support@urbit.org`.

There are two separate sequences of actions you need to take in order to reset.
One flow is for when you wish to keep Ethereum ownership address of the ship the
same, and the other is for when you are transferring the ship to a new Ethereum
ownership address. We make the emphasis about the Ethereum _ownership_ address
as changing your [proxies](https://developers.urbit.org/glossary/proxies) does not require a reset.

If you will be keeping your ship at the same Ethereum ownership address and
would like to perform a reset, follow the steps below.

- Go to [bridge.urbit.org](https://bridge.urbit.org) and log into your identity.
- Click on `OS: Urbit OS Settings` at the bottom, then click `Reset Networking Keys`.
- Check the `Breach Continuity` box. Click `Reset Networking Keys`, and then
  click `Send Transaction` and wait for the progress bar to appear.
- Download your new keyfile following these instructions: [Generate your
  keyfile](/manual/id/using-bridge#generate-your-keyfile).
- Delete or archive your old [pier](https://developers.urbit.org/glossary/pier).
- Proceed to [boot your ship](/manual/getting-started/self-hosted/self-hosted/cli#boot-your-planet) with the
  new keyfile.
- Delete your keyfile after successfully booting.
- Rejoin your favorite chat channels and subscriptions.

If you are transferring a ship to a new Ethereum ownership address you will have
the choice as to whether or not you want to reset. This is to cover the case
when you are transferring to another address you own. The process here is
slightly different.

- Go to [bridge.urbit.org](https://bridge.urbit.org) and log into your identity.
- Click on `ID: Identity and security settings` at the bottom, then click
  `Transfer this point`.
- Enter the new Ethereum address you would like to transfer ownership to. Click
  `Generate & Sign Transaction`, then click `Send Transaction` and wait for the
  progress bar to complete.
- Logout of your current session in Bridge by clicking `Logout` at the top, and
  then login to your new ownership address.
- From here, following the directions on how to [Accept your
  transfer](/manual/id/using-bridge#accept-your-transfer), [Set your networking
  keys](/manual/id/using-bridge#set-your-networking-keys), and [Generate your
  keyfile](/manual/id/using-bridge#generate-your-keyfile). The option whether or
  not to reset is in the Accept your Transfer step.
- Delete or archive your old [pier](https://developers.urbit.org/glossary/pier).
- Proceed to [boot your ship](/manual/getting-started/self-hosted/self-hosted/cli#boot-your-planet) with the
  new keyfile.
- Delete your keyfile after successfully booting.
- Rejoin your favorite chat channels and subscriptions.

## Network Resets

Network resets were events where all ships on the network were required to
update to a new continuity era. Network resets happened when an Arvo update
was released that could not be implemented via an [OTA
update](https://developers.urbit.org/glossary/ota-updates). The continuity era is given by an integer
in Ames that is incremented when the network resets. Only ships with the same
such value are able to communicate with one another. The most recent network
reset occurred in December 2020, and we expect it to have been the final one.

If another network reset does occur, we will provide accompanying documentation
on what to do to transfer your ship and all of its data to the new era.

## Breaches

Factory resets used to be called _breaches_, and you may find this terminology
still used in some places. This is an identical concept - only the name differs.
