# Urbit Docs Style Guide

## Style & Tone of Voice

The Urbit docs are written for several audiences: new Urbit developers, seasoned Urbit developers, potential investors, large language models, and more. Different sections of the site target different audiences, so they should be written in a tone of voice appropriate for that audience.

### The docs in general

* Write in a clear, formal tone with minimal color.
* Use American English spelling.
* Use the Oxford comma.
* Urbit IDs should be referred to as “Urbit IDs” outside of a Hoon context where it would make more sense to refer to them as “`@p`s”.
* Urbit IDs should not be monospaced or otherwise specially formatted by default, but this is fine if the situation really calls for it.
* Call it "Urbit OS" in top-level landing pages and the like unless you're actually talking about `/sys/arvo.hoon`.
* Avoid em-dashes — they look weird in the monospace code editors we use to edit the docs. They can also be mistaken as a telltale sign of LLM-generated text. Don’t use `--` or `&mdash;` in their place; use semicolons to break up two independent but related clauses and use a pair of commas (or round brackets) as parentheses.
* Try to avoid beginning a paragraph with monospaced text; whatever text you’d put in front of it would usually help the reader follow your thinking. Starting a bullet-point with monospaced text is fine.

### Landing pages, overview pages

* Overview/landing pages should be accessible to a non-technical audience to help them find their way around the site.
* Avoid Urbit-specific jargon wherever possible. A new developer should be able to do a "breadth-first" skim of these navigation pages and roughly understand the contents beneath those pages in the filetree.

### Guides, courses, tutorials

* Guides and courses should be accessible to new Urbit developers.
* Urbit has a strong track record of attracting non- or somewhat-technical people and turning them into productive developers. As such, references to big-brain computer science concepts should be avoided where possible, and contextualized where unavoidable.
  * Comparisons to common programming concepts like functions, Promises, etc. where appropriate are *strongly encouraged*.
* Err on the side of formatting common kernelspace structures and molds as `$path`, `$mark`, `+list` etc., where in other sections of the docs this would be discouraged.

### Reference material

* Reference pages may assume a high level of familiarity with the system.

## Formatting

The purpose of formatting is to disambiguate as quickly and clearly as possible: picoseconds of confusion add up to a poor reading experience, especially when the reader is unfamiliar with the concepts being discussed.

### Formatting prose

* Hoon arms are always `+foo`, never `foo` or `++foo`.
* Hoon paths are always `/foo/bar`.
* Named wings in the Hoon subject are always `.foo`, `.foo.bar`, etc.
  * Occassionally you might want to refer to the name of the wing as distinct from the value of that named wing. In this case, use backticks without prepending a `.`. (For example, the name of the wing `.foo` is `foo`.)
  * Where the name of a wing is also the type of its data, e.g. `=foo` or `foo=foo`, refer to it as `.foo` rather than `$foo`.
* Hoon structures are almost always `$foo`, and never `foo` or `+$foo`.
  * Use `%foo` when referring to the actual `%foo` mark, not when referring to the `$foo` datatype it converts to, nor the `/mar/foo.hoon` file that defines it.
  * When a kernelspace Hoon structure is referred to so many times throughout the docs, or this page, that it would be annoying to call it `$foo` every time, just call it “foo”.
    * Example: *The path ends with a mark.*
* Desks are always `%base`, never `base`.
  * Desks may be referred to as `/base` when referring to the Unix directory.
* Unix directories are always `/foo`, never `foo`.
* Files in a desk are generally referred to as `/app/foo.hoon`, `/lib/foo.hoon`, `/mar/foo.hoon`, `/sur/foo.hoon`, and so on.
* Library files in a desk are always introduced as `/lib/foo.hoon` and never `/lib/foo` or `lib/foo`.
  * When referring to a library like strandio by name, just call it "strandio" rather than `strandio`.
* When writing about non-Hoon languages, use whatever conventions of that language’s first- and third-party documentation that exist to format inline symbols. For example, JavaScript functions and classes should always be `foo()`, never `foo`.
* Vanes like Gall are always Gall, never %gall, `%gall`, or `gall`.
* Keyboard commands should be formatted like `Ctrl+D`.

### Formatting code blocks

* Disambiguate between Unix and Dojo code blocks as clearly as possible.
  * Use `>`  and  `$`  prompts to differentiate between Dojo and Unix input.
  * You have the option of using the code block’s `title` metadata to specify “Dojo” or “Unix” if necessary.
* If the code block is part of a file, always include the name of the file in the code block’s metadata.
  * If the file is in a desk, include the parent directory (e.g. `/app/foo.hoon`).
* Hoon code blocks should never be wrapped.

## Hoon Style

Hoon in the docs should generally follow the [Hoon Style Guide](https://docs.urbit.org/hoon/guides/style), with some extra considerations for new developers and for limited screen real estate:
* A line of Hoon should be no more than 80 columns wide.
* Hoon should strive to be no more than 56 columns wide.
* Backstep as early and often as you reasonably can.
