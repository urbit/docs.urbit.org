# System

This section of the docs contains guides and reference material for the three basic components of the system: the Arvo kernel, the Vere runtime and Azimuth, the PKI and identity system on the Ethereum blockchain.

While most of the app-related documentation is in the [Userspace](../userspace) section, the [Kernel](../urbit-os/kernel) documentation is a useful reference when interacting with Vanes from apps.

- [Runtime](../system/runtime) - Urbit's runtime is called Vere. It interprets compiled Nock, handles I/O, and manages state checkpoints and the event log.
