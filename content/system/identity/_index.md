Azimuth is a general-purpose public-key infrastructure (PKI) on the Ethereum
blockchain, used as a platform for _Urbit identities_. You need such an identity
to use the Arvo network.

The primary way to interact with Azimuth is through
[Bridge](https://github.com/urbit/bridge) and the node libraries that it
depends on, [azimuth-js](https://github.com/urbit/azimuth-js) and
[urbit-key-generation](https://github.com/urbit/urbit-key-generation). Take a
look at the source and play around, or see [Getting
Started](/manual/getting-started).

## Arvo vs. Azimuth

Urbit is a project, not a single computer system. It has multiple components:
Arvo, the operating system, and Azimuth, the identity system. Let's compare
them.

**Arvo** is an operating system that provides the software for a personal
server. These personal servers together constitute the peer-to-peer Arvo
network. To make this network work on the social level, Arvo is built to work
with a system of scarce and immutable identities.

**Azimuth** is the public-key infrastructure built to be a system of scarce and
immutable identities. It consists of a suite of [smart contracts on the Ethereum
blockchain](https://github.com/urbit/azimuth) as well as [several
apps](/system/identity/concepts/flow) run locally on your urbit. Togeter, they determine
which Ethereum addresses own which Urbit ID's as well as the public keys needed
to communicate with those ID's. All identity-related operations, such as
transfers, are governed by Azimuth. Azimuth isn't built strictly for Arvo -- the
smart contracts on Ethereum are sufficient to be used as a generalized identity
system for other projects. Azimuth is considered to be the technical
nomenclature for the PKI, while Urbit ID is the common nomenclature.

These otherwise-parallel systems meet when you want to connect to the Arvo
network. Your Arvo personal server, called your _ship_, needs to be able to
prove cryptographically that it is who it says it is. This proof comes in the
form of a keyfile, derived from your identity, that you use to start your ship.

A metaphor might help illustrate the relationship between these two systems: the
Arvo network is the neighborhood that you live in; Azimuth is the bank vault
that stores the deed to your house.

## Smart contracts

Azimuth consists of the following smart contracts:

- [Azimuth.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/azimuth.eth)
  `0x223c067f8cf28ae173ee5cafea60ca44c335fecb`: contains all on-chain state for
  Azimuth. Most notably, ownership and public keys. Can't be modified directly,
  you must use the Ecliptic.
- [Ecliptic.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/ecliptic.eth):
  `0x9ef27de616154FF8B38893C59522b69c7Ba8A81c ` is used as an interface for
  interacting with your points on-chain. Allows you to configure keys, transfer
  ownership, etc.
- [Polls](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fecab617c868bb5996d99d95200d2fa708218e4):
  `0x7fecab617c868bb5996d99d95200d2fa708218e4` registers votes by the Galactic
  Senate on proposals. These can be either static documents or Ecliptic
  upgrades.
- [Linear Star
  Release](https://etherscan.io/address/0x86cd9cd0992f04231751e3761de45cecea5d1801):
  facilitates the release of blocks of stars to their owners over a period of
  time.
- [Conditional Star
  Release](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c241098c3d3498fe1261421633fd57986d74aea):
  `0x8c241098c3d3498fe1261421633fd57986d74aea` facilitates the release of
  blocks of stars to their owners based on milestones.
- [Claims](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7e7f69b34d7d9bd8d61fb22c33b22708947971a):
  `0xe7e7f69b34d7d9bd8d61fb22c33b22708947971a` allows point owners to make
  claims about (for example) their identity, and associate that with their
  point.
- [Censures](https://etherscan.io/address/0x325f68d32bdee6ed86e7235ff2480e2a433d6189):
  `0x325f68d32bdee6ed86e7235ff2480e2a433d6189` simple reputation management,
  allowing galaxies and stars to flag points for negative reputation.
- [Delegated
  Sending](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf6b461fe1ad4bd2ce25b23fe0aff2ac19b3dfa76):
  enables network-effect like distributing of planets.

## Naive rollups

In 2021, Tlon introduced a new system to Azimuth intended to reduce gas costs
for working with Urbit ID and friction associated with using cryptocurrency in
general called **naive rollups**, often referred to as **layer 2** or L2. This system
allows batches of Azimuth transactions to be submitted together as a single
transaction using an Urbit node known as a "roller". The PKI state transitions
resulting from these transactions are computed locally by your urbit rather than
by the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).

Due to the dramatically reduced cost, Tlon offers their own roller that is free
for ordinary public use. This enables new users to get started with a permanent
Azimuth identity without any prior knowledge of Ethereum, cryptocurrency, or
blockchains. However, anybody can run a roller, and even using your own ship as
a roller to submit single transactions results in significant savings.

A casual overview of the naive rollups system can be found on the
[blog](https://urbit.org/blog/rollups). Developers are encouraged to read our Layer 2
documentation, starting with the [Layer 2 Overview](/system/identity/concepts/layer2).
