# Fundamentals

## Introduction {#introduction}

A thread is like a transient gall agent. Unlike an agent, it can end and it can fail. The primary uses for threads are:

1. Complex IO, like making a bunch of external API calls where each call depends on the last. Doing this in an agent significantly increases its complexity and the risk of a mishandled intermediary state corrupting permanent state. If you spin the IO out into a thread, your agent only has to make one call to the thread and receive one response.
2. Testing - threads are very useful for writing complex tests for your agents.

Threads are managed by the Gall agent called `%spider`. You can poke `%spider` directly, or you can pass a task to the Khan thread runner vane and let it handle `%spider` for you.

Threads can be run from a file in the `/ted` directory, or an "inline thread" can be passed directly to Khan from within your agent.

## Thread file location {#thread-file-location}

Thread files live in the `/ted` directory of each desk. For example, in a desk named `%sandbox`:

```
%sandbox
├──app
├──gen
├──lib
├──mar
├──sur
└──ted <-
   ├──foo
   │  └──bar.hoon
   └──baz.hoon
```

From the dojo, `ted/baz.hoon` can be run with `-sandbox!baz`, and `ted/foo/bar.hoon` with `-sandbox!foo-bar`. Threads in the `%base` desk can just be run like `-foo`, but all others must have the format `-desk!thread`.

## Libraries {#libraries}

There are two libraries that may be relevant:

- `/sur/spider/hoon` - this contains a few simple structures used by `%spider`. It's only relevant if you're running thread files by poking `%spider` directly. If you're running them by passing a task to Khan as is typical, it can be ignored.
- `/lib/strandio/hoon` - this contains a large collection of ready-made functions for use in threads. You'll likely use many of these when you write threads, so it's very useful.

## Thread definition {#thread-definition}

A thread is defined as a `$-(vase shed:khan)`. That is, a gate that takes a `$vase` and produces a `$shed:khan`. A `$shed:khan` is the `+form` of a strand that produces a `$vase`. This is a little confusing and we'll look at each part in detail later. For now, note that the thread doesn't just produce a result, it actually produces a strand that takes input and produces output from which a result can be extracted. It works something like this:

![thread diagram](https://media.urbit.org/site/thread-diagram.png "diagram of a thread")

This is because threads typically do a bunch of I/O so it can't just immediately produce a result and end. Instead the strand will get some input, produce output, get some new input, produce new output, and so forth, until they eventually produce a `%done` with the actual final result.

## Strands {#strands}

Strands are the building blocks of threads. A thread will typically compose multiple strands.

A strand is a function of `$strand-input:rand` to `$output:strand:rand`, the latter of which is a `+strand-output-raw:rand` initialized with a particular mold:

{% code title="$strand-input:rand" %}

```hoon
+$  strand-input
  $+  strand-input
  [=bowl in=(unit input)]
```

{% endcode %}

{% code title="$strand-output-raw:rand" %}

```hoon
++  strand-output-raw
    |*  a=mold
    $+  strand-output-raw
    $~  [~ %done *a]
    $:  cards=(list card)
        $=  next
        $%  [%wait ~]
            [%skip ~]
            [%cont self=(strand-form-raw a)]
            [%fail err=error]
            [%done value=a]
        ==
    ==
```

{% endcode %}

At this stage you don't need to know the nitty-gritty details but it's helpful to have a quick look through the `+rand` arm in `lull.hoon`. We'll discuss these things in more detail later.

A strand is a core that has three important arms:

- `+form` - the mold of the strand
- `+pure` - produces a strand that does nothing except return a value
- `+bind` - monadic bind, like `then` in javascript promises

We'll discuss each of these arms later.

A strand must be specialised to produce a particular type like `(strand:rand ,<type>)`. As previously mentioned, a `thread` produces a `$vase` so is specialised like `(strand:rand ,vase)`. Within your thread you'll likely compose multiple strands which produce different types like `(strand:rand ,@ud)`, `(strand:rand ,[path cage])`, etc, but the thread itself will always come back to a `(strand:rand ,vase)`.

Strands are conventionally given the face `m` like:

```hoon
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
...
```

**NOTE:** a comma prefix as in `,vase` is the irregular form of [`^:` ketcol](../../../../hoon/rune/ket.md#ketcol) which produces a gate that returns the sample value if it's of the correct type, but crashes otherwise.

## Form and Pure {#form-and-pure}

### `+form` {#form}

The `+form` arm is the mold of the strand, suitable for casting. The two other arms produce `+form`s so you'll cast everything to this like:

```hoon
=/  m  (strand:rand ,@ud)
^-  form:m
...
```

### `+pure` {#pure}

Pure produces a strand that does nothing except return a value. So, `(pure:(strand:rand ,@tas) %foo)` is a strand that produces `%foo` without doing any IO.

We'll cover `+bind` later.

## A trivial thread {#a-trivial-thread}

```hoon
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
^-  form:m
(pure:m arg)
```

The above code is a simple thread that just returns its argument, and it's a good boilerplate to start from.

Save the above code as a file in `ted/mythread.hoon` and `|commit` it. Run it with `-mythread 'foo'`, you should see the following:

```
> -mythread 'foo'
[~ 'foo']
```

**NOTE:** The dojo wraps arguments in a unit so that's why it's `[~ 'foo']` rather than just `'foo'`.

## Analysis {#analysis}

We'll go through it line-by line.

```hoon
|=  arg=vase
```

We create a gate that takes a vase, the first part of the previously mentioned thread definition.

```hoon
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
```

Inside the gate we create our `+strand` specialised to produce a `$vase` and give it the canonical face `m`.

```hoon
^-  form:m
```

We cast the output to `+form` - the mold of the strand we created.

```hoon
(pure:m arg)
```

Finally we call `+pure` with the gate input `arg` as its argument. Since `arg` is a `$vase` it will return the `+form` of a `+strand` which produces a `$vase`. Thus we've created a thread in accordance with its type definition.

## Inline Threads {#inline-threads}

While you can store threads as files in the `/ted` directory, you can also include threads directly in your Gall agent code and ask the Khan vane to run them.

While a stand-alone thread file is expected to be a `$-(vase shed:khan)`, an inline thread is just a `$shed:khan`. That is, it doesn't take any initial argument argument. Instead, you can simply reference any data and functions available in its subject in the Gall agent.

Here's how a trivial inline thread that'll just return `123`, a number pinned previously in the Gall agent, might look:

```hoon
=/  dat=@ud  123
=/  =shed:khan
  =/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
  ^-  form:m
  (pure:m !>(dat))
```

The `$shed` can then be passed to Kahn in card:

```hoon
[%pass /thread %arvo %k %lard %mydesk shed]~
```

The result will come back into the `+on-arvo` arm of the Gall agent in an [`%arow`](../../../kernel/khan/tasks.md#arow) gift. 

Next we'll look at the third arm of a strand: `+bind`.
