# Child Thread

Here's a simple example of a thread that starts another thread:

{% code title="/ted/parent.hoon" overflow="nowrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```hoon
/+  *strandio
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
^-  form:m
;<  =tid:rand  bind:m  (start-thread %child)
(pure:m !>(~))
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="/ted/child.hoon" overflow="nowrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```hoon
/+  *strandio
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
^-  form:m
%-  (slog leaf+"foo" ~)
(pure:m !>(~))
```
{% endcode %}

Save `parent.hoon` and `child.hoon` in `/ted` of the `%base` desk, `|commit %base` and run `-parent`. You should see something like:

```
foo
> -parent
~
```

`parent.hoon` just uses the `strandio` function `+start-thread` to start `child.hoon`, and `child.hoon` just prints `foo` to the dojo. Since we got `foo` we can tell the second thread did, in fact, run.

```hoon
;<  =tid:rand  bind:m  (start-thread %child)
```

See here how we gave `+start-thread` the name of the thread to run. It returns the `$tid` (thread ID) of the thread, which we could then use to poke it or whatever.

`+start-thread` handles creating the `$tid` for the thread so is quite convenient.

Note that threads we start this way will be a child of the thread that started them, and so will be killed when the parent thread ends.

## Start thread and get its result {#start-thread-and-get-its-result}

If we want to actually get the result of the thread we started, it's slightly more complicated. We note that this is mostly the same as `+await-thread:strandio`.

{% code title="/ted/parent.hoon" overflow="nowrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```hoon
/+  *strandio
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
^-  form:m
;<  =bowl:rand  bind:m  get-bowl
=/  tid  `@ta`(cat 3 'strand_' (scot %uv (sham %child eny.bowl)))
;<  ~           bind:m  (watch-our /awaiting/[tid] %spider /thread-result/[tid])
;<  ~           bind:m  %-  poke-our
                        :*  %spider
                            %spider-start
                            !>([`tid.bowl `tid byk.bowl(r da+now.bowl) %child !>(~)])
                        ==
;<  =cage       bind:m  (take-fact /awaiting/[tid])
;<  ~           bind:m  (take-kick /awaiting/[tid])
?+  p.cage  ~|([%strange-thread-result p.cage %child tid] !!)
  %thread-done  (pure:m q.cage)
  %thread-fail  (strand-fail:rand !<([term tang] q.cage))
==
```

{% code title="/ted/child.hoon" overflow="nowrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```hoon
/+  *strandio
|%
++  url  "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"
+$  todo  [user-id=@ud id=@ud title=@t completed=?]
++  decode
  =,  dejs:format
  (ot ['userId' ni] ['id' ni] ['title' so] ['completed' bo] ~)
--
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
^-  form:m
;<  =json  bind:m  (fetch-json url)
(pure:m !>(`todo`(decode json)))
```

`child.hoon` simply grabs the JSON response from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and converts it to a noun.

`parent.hoon` is a bit more complicated so we'll look at it line-by-line

```hoon
;<  =bowl:rand  bind:m  get-bowl
```

First we grab the bowl

```hoon
=/  tid  `@ta`(cat 3 'strand_' (scot %uv (sham %child eny.bowl)))
```

Then we generate a `$tid` for the thread we're going to start

```hoon
;<  ~  bind:m  (watch-our /awaiting/[tid] %spider /thread-result/[tid])
```

We pre-emptively subscribe for the result. Spider sends the result at `/thread-result/[tid]` so that's where we subscribe.

```hoon
;<  ~  bind:m  %-  poke-our
               :*  %spider
                   %spider-start
                   !>([`tid.bowl `tid byk.bowl(r da+now.bowl) %child !>(~)])
               ==
```

Spider takes a poke with a mark `%spider-start` and a vase containing `[parent=(unit tid) use=(unit tid) =beak file=term =vase]` to start a thread, where:

- `.parent` is an optional parent thread. In this case we say the parent is our tid. Specifying a parent means the child will be killed if the parent ends.
- `.use` is the thread ID for the thread we're creating
- `.beak` is a `[p=ship q=desk r=case]` triple which specifies the desk and revision containing the thread we want to run. In this case we just use `byk.bowl`, but with the date of revision `r` changed to `now.bowl`.
- `.file` is the filename of the thread we want to start
- `.vase` is the vase it will be given as an argument when it's started

```hoon
;<  =cage  bind:m  (take-fact /awaiting/[tid])
```

We wait for a fact which will be the result of the thread.

```hoon
;<  ~  bind:m  (take-kick /awaiting/[tid])
```

Spider will kick us from the subscription when it ends the thread so we also take that kick.

```hoon
?+  p.cage  ~|([%strange-thread-result p.cage %child tid] !!)
  %thread-done  (pure:m q.cage)
  %thread-fail  (strand-fail !<([term tang] q.cage))
==
```

Finally we test whether the thread produced a `%thread-done` or a `%thread-fail`. These are the two possible marks produced by spider when it returns the results of a thread. A `%thread-done` will contain a vase with the result, and a `%thread-fail` will contain an error message and traceback, so we see which it is and then either produce the result with `+pure` or trigger a `%thread-fail` with the error we got from the child.

## Stop a thread {#stop-a-thread}

{% code title="/ted/parent.hoon" overflow="nowrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```hoon
/+  *strandio
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
^-  form:m
;<  =bowl:rand  bind:m  get-bowl
=/  tid  `@ta`(cat 3 'strand_' (scot %uv (sham %child eny.bowl)))
%-  (slog leaf+"Starting child thread..." ~)
;<  ~           bind:m  %-  poke-our
                        :*  %spider
                            %spider-start
                            !>([`tid.bowl `tid byk.bowl(r da+now.bowl) %child !>(~)])
                        ==
;<  ~           bind:m  (sleep ~s5)
%-  (slog leaf+"Stopping child thread..." ~)
;<  ~           bind:m  %-  poke-our
                        :*  %spider
                            %spider-stop
                            !>([tid %.y])
                        ==
;<  ~           bind:m  (sleep ~s2)
%-  (slog leaf+"Done" ~)
(pure:m !>(~))
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="/ted/child.hoon" overflow="nowrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```hoon
/+  *strandio
=>
|%
++  looper
  =/  m  (strand:rand ,~)
  ^-  form:m
  %-  (main-loop ,~)
  :~  |=  ~
      ^-  form:m
      ;<  ~  bind:m  (sleep `@dr`(div ~s1 2))
      %-  (slog leaf+"child thread" ~)
      (pure:m ~)
  ==
--
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand:rand ,vase)
^-  form:m
;<  ~  bind:m  looper
(pure:m !>(~))
```
{% endcode %}

`child.hoon` just prints to the dojo in a loop.

`parent.hoon` starts `child.hoon`, and then pokes Spider like:

```hoon
;<  ~  bind:m  %-  poke-our
               :*  %spider
                   %spider-stop
                   !>([tid %.y])
               ==
```

- `%spider-stop` is the mark that tells Spider to kill a thread.
- `$tid` is the tid of the thread to kill
- `%.y` tells Spider to suppress traceback in the result of the killed thread. If you give it `%.n` it will include the traceback.
