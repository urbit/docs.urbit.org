# Take Result

Here we've added an extra card to subscribe for the result and a couple of lines in on-agent to test if it succeeded:

#### `thread-starter.hoon`

         =/  err  !<  (pair term tang)  q.cage.sign
         %-  (slog leaf+"Thread failed: {(trip p.err)}" q.err)
         `this
           %thread-done
         =/  res  (trip !<(term q.cage.sign))
         %-  (slog leaf+"Result: {res}" ~)
         `this
       ==
     ==
   ==
++  on-arvo   on-arvo:def
++  on-fail   on-fail:def
--
```

#### `test-thread.hoon`

```hoon
/-  spider
=,  strand=strand:spider
^-  thread:spider
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand ,vase)
^-  form:m
|=  strand-input:strand
?+    q.arg  [~ %fail %not-foo ~]
    %foo
  [~ %done arg]
==
```

Save these, `|commit` and then poke the app with `:thread-starter [%test-thread %foo]`. You should see:

```
Thread started successfully
Result: foo
```

Now try `:thread-starter [%test-thread %bar]`. You should see:

```
Thread started successfully
Thread failed: not-foo
```

### Analysis {#analysis}

In `on-poke` we've added an extra card _before_ the `%spider-start` poke to subscribe for the result:

```hoon
[%pass /thread/[ta-now] %agent [our.bowl %spider] %watch /thread-result/[tid]]
```

If successful the thread will return a cage with a mark of `%thread-done` and a vase containing the result.

If the thread failed it will return a cage with a mark of `%thread-fail` and a vase containing `[term tang]` where `term` is an error message and `tang` is a traceback. In our case our thread fails with error `%not-foo` when its argument is not `%foo`.

Note that spider will automatically `%kick` us from the subscription after ending the thread and returning the result.

```hoon
  %fact
?+    p.cage.sign  (on-agent:def wire sign)
    %thread-fail
  =/  err  !<  (pair term tang)  q.cage.sign
  %-  (slog leaf+"Thread failed: {(trip p.err)}" q.err)
  `this
    %thread-done
  =/  res  (trip !<(term q.cage.sign))
  %-  (slog leaf+"Result: {res}" ~)
  `this
==
```

Here in on-agent we've added a test for `%thread-fail` or `%thread-done` and print the appropriate result.
