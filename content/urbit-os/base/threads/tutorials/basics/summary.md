That's basically all you need to know to write threads. The best way to get a good handle on them is just to experiment with some `strandio` functions. For information on running threads from gall agents, see [here](/userspace/threads/examples/gall) and for some examples see [here](/userspace/threads/examples).

Now here's a quick recap of the main points covered:

## Spider

- is the gall agent that manages threads.
- Details of interacting with threads via spider can be seen [here](/userspace/threads/reference/api).

## Threads

- are like transient gall agents
- are used mostly to chain a series of IO operations
- can be used by gall agents to spin out IO operations
- live in the `ted` directory
- are managed by the gall agent `spider`
- take a `vase` and produce a `strand` which produces a `vase`

#### Example

```hoon
/-  spider
=,  strand=strand:spider
^-  thread:spider
|=  arg=vase
=/  m  (strand ,vase)
^-  form:m
(pure:m arg)
```

## Strands

- are the building blocks of threads
- take [this](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/pkg/base-dev/lib/strand.hoon#L2-L21) input and produce [this](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/pkg/base-dev/lib/strand.hoon#L23-L48) output.
- must be specialised to produce a particular type like `(strand ,@ud)`.
- are conventionally given the face `m`.
- are a core that has three main arms - `form`, `pure` and `bind`:

### form

- is the mold of the strand suitable for casting
- is the type returned by the other arms

### pure

- simply returns the `form` of a `strand` that produces pure's argument without doing any IO

### bind

- is used to chain strands together like javascript promises
- is used in conjunction with micgal (`;<`)
- must be specialised to a type like `;< <type> bind:m ...`
- takes two arguments. The first is a function that returns the `form` of a `strand` that produces `<type>`. The second is a gate whose sample is `<type>` and which returns a `form`.
- calls the first and then, if it succeeded, calls the second with the result of the first as its sample.

## Strand input

- looks like `[=bowl in=(unit input)]`
- `bowl` has things like `our`, `now`, `eny` and so forth
- `bowl` is populated once when the thread is first called and then every time it receives new input
- `input` contains any incoming pokes, signs and watches.

## Strand output

- contains `[cards=(list card:agent:gall) <response>]`
- `cards` are any cards to be sent immediately
- `<response>` is something like `[%done value]`, `[%fail err]`, etc.
- `%done` will contain the result
- responses are only used internally to manage the flow of the thread and are not returned to subscribers.

## Strandio

- is located in `/lib/strandio/hoon`
- contains a collection of ready-made functions for use in threads
- eg. `sleep`, `get-bowl`, `take-watch`, `poke`, `fetch-json`, etc.
