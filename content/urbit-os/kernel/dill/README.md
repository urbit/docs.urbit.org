# Dill

The terminal driver vane.

Keyboard events and the like from Unix are received by Dill as [%belt](reference/tasks.md#belt) `task`s, and Dill sends `%blit` `gift`s containing [$blit](reference/data-types.md#blit)s back to the runtime to be displayed in the Unix terminal. The manner of interacting with Dill differs depending on whether you're in userspace or kernelspace, as we'll explore below.

## Kernelspace {#kernelspace}

For technical reasons, Dill performs a handful of system tasks related to booting a ship and some memory operations. Aside from those, other Vanes mostly just pass Dill [tasks](reference/tasks.md) to print error messages and the like to the terminal.

## Userspace {#userspace}

Unlike in kernelspace, userspace applications are unlikely to `%pass` Dill `task`s directly. Instead, Dill looks at things in terms of sessions. A session is a pipeline between a client and a handler, where:

- The client is an external input source and output sink; a terminal with dimensions and so forth.
- The handler is an application in Urbit that interprets input, maybe does something with it, maybe produces output to be displayed in the client, etc. The handler may itself handle and multiplex terminal interfaces for other applications, as is the case with the `%hood` module `%drum`, or it may be a stand-alone application.

Currently, Dill supports multiple *sessions*, but Vere (the runtime) only supports a single Unix terminal *client* for the default session (`%$`). This means any non-default sessions will need to be linked through the default session handler `%drum` (a module of the `%hood` app) if they are to work in the Unix terminal. Alternatively, a client could be built that talks to Dill via the HTTP server Eyre in a similar way to the `%webterm` app, and interacts with sessions entirely separately from the Unix terminal and its `%drum` handler.

`%drum` is Arvo's CLI app manager. By default you'll have one CLI application running: the `%dojo`. You may also have additional CLI apps which you have started or attached with the `|dojo/link` command. It's `%drum` that keeps track of which one is active, which one input should be routed to, which one should be displayed, what each prompt should look like, and so forth. Dill itself is oblivious to the distinction between these CLI apps. It only sees the session with `%drum`, so it just passes all input to `%drum` and display whatever `%drum` gives it.

While `%drum` talks with Dill in `$dill-belt`s and `$dill-blit`s, it talks to CLI apps with `$sole-action`s and `$sole-event`s, which are defined in the `sole` library. For more information on the `sole` library and the related `shoe` library, and for information on how to build CLI apps, you can refer to the [CLI app tutorial](../../../userspace/apps/guides/cli-tutorial.md).

To give a basic idea of how keyboard events flow through these systems and produce terminal output, here's a diagram showing the messages in pseudo-Hoon:
