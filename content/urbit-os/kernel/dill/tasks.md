# Dill API Reference

In this document we describe the public interface for Dill. Namely, we describe each `task` that Dill can be `pass`ed, and which `gift`(s) Dill can `give` in return.

Dill's `task`s are organized into three categories: [Session `task`s](tasks.md#session-tasks) for interacting with a particular session, [Told `task`s](tasks.md#told-tasks) for basic terminal printing, and [system/miscellaneous `task`s](tasks.md#system-misc-tasks) which are a combination of general system `task`s and Dill `task`s which don't fit in the previous two categories.

## System & Misc. Tasks <a href="#system-misc-tasks" id="system-misc-tasks"></a>

These are the Dill `task`s not otherwise categorized as [session tasks](tasks.md#session-tasks) or [told tasks](tasks.md#told-tasks). Most of them are interfaces for Vere or Arvo and do thing like toggle verbose mode, defragment state, etc. The most notable Dill-specific `task` is [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot), which is used as a wrapper for the [session tasks](tasks.md#session-tasks) to specify the session. The [`%logs`](tasks.md#logs) `task` is also useful, letting you subscribe to all system output.

### `%boot` <a href="#boot" id="boot"></a>

```hoon
[%boot lit=? p=*]
```

This `task` is used only once, when Arvo first enters the [adult stage](../arvo/README.md#structural-interface-core). Dill is technically the first vane to be activated, via the `%boot` `task`, which then sends Jael (considered the "true" first vane) the `%dawn` or `%fake` `task` wrapped in the `%boot` `task`. Jael then goes on to call `%init` `task`s for other vanes (including Dill).

`lit` specifies whether to boot in lite mode. `p` is either a [%dawn](../jael/tasks.md#dawn) or [%fake](../jael/tasks.md#fake) `task:jael`. `%dawn` is for an ordinary boot and `%fake` is for booting a fake ship.

This `task` would not be used from userspace.

#### Returns

Dill returns no `gift` in response to a `%boot` `task`, but it will `%pass` the wrapped `%dawn` or `%fake` `task` to Jael.

***

### `%crop` <a href="#crop" id="crop"></a>

Trim kernel state.

```hoon
[%crop p=@ud]
```

This `task` is the same as the `%trim` vane `task`. Like `%trim`, Dill does nothing with it.

#### Returns

Dill returns no `gift` in response to a `%crop` `task`.

***

### `%flog` <a href="#flog" id="flog"></a>

```hoon
[%flog p=flog]
```

A `%flog` `task` is a wrapper over a `task` sent by another vane. Dill removes the wrapper and sends the bare `task` to itself over the default `duct`.

A `%flog` `task` takes a [$flog](data-types.md#flog) as its argument. A `$flog` is a subset of Dill's `task`s.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%flog` `task`.

***

### `%heft` <a href="#heft" id="heft"></a>

Produce memory report.

```hoon
[%heft ~]
```

When Dill receives a `%heft` `task` it passes Arvo a `%whey` `waif` to obtain a memory report and prints it to the terminal.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%heft` `task`.

***

### `%logs` <a href="#logs" id="logs"></a>

Watch system output.

```hoon
[%logs p=(unit ~)]
```

A non-null `p` subscribes to system output, and a null `p` unsubscribes. While subscribed, you'll receive each piece of output in a `%logs` gift as it occurs.

#### Returns

Dill does not immediately return anything, but will give you a `%logs` gifts each time system output occurs. A `%logs` gift looks like:

```hoon
[%logs =told]
```

A `$told` is either a [`%crud`](tasks.md#crud), [`%talk`](tasks.md#talk) or [`%text`](tasks.md#text) task. See the [`$told`](data-types.md#dill-belt) entry in the data types reference for more details.

***

### `%meld` <a href="#meld" id="meld"></a>

Deduplicate persistent state.

```hoon
[%meld ~]
```

Dill asks the runtime to perform the memory deduplication.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%meld` `task`.

***

### `%pack` <a href="#pack" id="pack"></a>

Defragment persistent state.

```hoon
[%pack ~]
```

Dill asks the runtime to perform the defragmentation.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%meld` `task`.

***

### `%seat` <a href="#seat" id="seat"></a>

Install desk.

```hoon
[%seat =desk]
```

This indirectly pokes `%hood` with a `%kiln-install` `mark` to install the specified `desk`. You should just poke `%hood` directly rather than using this.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%seat` `task`.

***

### `%shot` <a href="#shot" id="shot"></a>

Task for session.

```hoon
[%shot ses=@tas task=session-task]
```

A `$session-task` is one of these `task`s: [`%belt`](tasks.md#belt), [`%blew`](tasks.md#blew), [`%flee`](tasks.md#flee), [`%hail`](tasks.md#hail), [`%open`](tasks.md#open), [`%shut`](tasks.md#shut), [`%view`](tasks.md#view). See the [`$session-task`](data-types.md#session-task) entry in the data types reference.

***

### `%verb` <a href="#verb" id="verb"></a>

Toggle Arvo verbose mode.

```hoon
[%verb ~]
```

This `task` toggles verbose mode for all of Arvo, which is located here since Dill is the vane that prints errors. To be precise, `%verb` toggles the laconic bit `lac` in the [Arvo state](../arvo/README.md#the-state) by passing a `%verb` `waif` to Arvo.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%verb` `task`.

***

## Session Tasks <a href="#session-tasks" id="session-tasks"></a>

These `task`s are for interacting with a particular session. These all would normally be wrapped in a [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task` to specify the session, rather than sent directly.

This subset of Dill's `task`s are defined in the [`$session-task` type](data-types.md#session-task).

### `%belt` <a href="#belt" id="belt"></a>

Terminal input.

```hoon
[%belt p=belt]
```

The [$belt](data-types.md#belt) in `p` contains the input such as which key was pressed. Dill will convert the `$belt` into a [$dill-belt](data-types.md#dill-belt) and `%poke` it into the session handler agent for the session in question.

This `task` should be wrapped in a [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task` to specify the session. Without the `%shot` wrapper, it will use the default session (`%$`).

#### Returns

Dill returns no `gift` in response to a `%belt` `task`.

***

### `%blew` <a href="#blew" id="blew"></a>

Terminal resized.

```hoon
[%blew p=blew]
```

The [$blew](data-types.md#blew) specifies the new dimensions.

Dill will convert the `$blew` into a `%rez` [$dill-belt](data-types.md#dill-belt) and `%poke`s the session handler (typically `drum`) with it.

This `task` would not typically be used from userspace. Instead, it would come in from the runtime for the default session (`%$`) when the actual terminal were resized. If in an odd scenario it were used from userspace, it would need to be wrapped in a [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task` to specify a session other than `%$`.

#### Returns

Dill returns no `gift` in response to a `%blew` `task`.

***

### `%flee` <a href="#flee" id="flee"></a>

Unwatch a session to which you've previously subscribed with [%view](tasks.md#view).

```hoon
[%flee ~]
```

This `task` must be wrapped in a [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task` in order to specify the session. Without that, it will default to the default session (`%$`). The subscription to end will be determined implicitly by the `duct`.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%flee` `task`.

***

### `%hail` <a href="#hail" id="hail"></a>

Refresh.

```hoon
[%hail ~]
```

Dill converts a `%hail` `task` into a `%hey` [$dill-belt](data-types.md#dill-belt) and `%poke`s the session handler (typically `%drum`) with it.

This `task` would not typically be used from userspace. If in an odd scenario it were used from userspace, it would need to be wrapped in a [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task` to specify a session other than `%$`.

#### Returns

Dill returns no `gift` in response to a `%hail` `task`.

***

### `%open` <a href="#open" id="open"></a>

Setup session.

```hoon
[%open p=dude:gall q=(list gill:gall)]
```

This `task` is always wrapped in a [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task`, and creates the new session specified in that wrapper. If it's not wrapped in a `%shot` task, it will default to the default session (`%$`) and fail because it already exists. This `task` is designed to be used by a userspace session handler like `%drum` that multiplexes terminal interfaces for multiple userspace applications, but could also be used by a stand-alone application that talks to Dill directly.

The Gall agent specified in `p` is the session handler or stand-alone application. The `q` field contains a list of `gill:gall`, which are pairs of `[ship term]`, representing an app on a ship. The `gill`s in `q` are the list of apps being managed by the session handler `q` that should be notified of being connected to this session. If `p` were a stand-alone application, `q` could be empty, or else just contain that one app.

Dill will poke every agent listed in `q` (local or remote) with a [`%yow` `$dill-belt`](data-types.md#dill-belt), to let it know it's been connected. It will also `%watch` the agent `p` for [`$dill-blit`](data-types.md#dill-blit)s in `%fact`s with a `%dill-blit` `mark` on the `path` `/dill/[ses]` where `ses` is the session specified in the [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) wrapper.

Additionally, the source of the `%open` request (as determined by the `duct`, typically the agent in `p`) will begin receiving terminal output gifts for the session in question. Essentially, it behaves as though you also passed it a [`%view`](tasks.md#view) task.

#### Returns

Dill does not give a `gift` in direct response to an `%open` `task`. It will, however, start giving terminal output `%blit` `gift`s to the requester as the occur for the session. A `%blit` `gift` looks like:

```hoon
[%blit p=(list blit)]
```

See the [`$blit`](data-types.md#blit) entry in the data type reference for details of what it can contain.

This subscription for `$blit`s can be stopped with a [`%flee`](tasks.md#flee) `task` at any time.

***

### `%shut` <a href="#shut" id="shut"></a>

Close session.

```hoon
[%shut ~]
```

This `task` needs to be wrapped in [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task` to specify the session to close. Otherwise, it will default to the default session (`%$`).

The session handler will be passed a `%leave`. Subscribers for `$blit`s will not be notified, they'll just stop receiving `$blit`s.

#### Returns

Dill does not give a `gift` in response to a `%shut` `task`. It will, however, pass a `%leave` to the session handler agent.

***

### `%view` <a href="#view" id="view"></a>

Watch session.

```hoon
[%view ~]
```

A `%view` `task` subscribes for a copy of all `%blit` `gift`s which Dill `%give`s for the session in question. This `task` must be wrapped in a [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) `task` which specifies the session if you want to subscribe to anything other than the default session (`%$`).

#### Returns

Dill will begin giving a copy of all `%blit`s for the session specified in the [`%shot`](tasks.md#shot) wrapper, or the default session (`%$`) if a `%shot` wrapper is not used. A `%blit` `gift` is:

```hoon
[%blit p=(list blit)]
```

See the [`$blit`](data-types.md#blit) entry in the data type reference for more details.

The subscription can be ended with a [`%flee`](tasks.md#flee) `task`.

***

## Told Tasks <a href="#told-tasks" id="told-tasks"></a>

This subset of Dill `task`s are for printing things. They are defined in the [`$told` type](data-types.md#told).

### `%crud` <a href="#crud" id="crud"></a>

Print error.

```hoon
[%crud p=@tas q=tang]
```

Dill prints the given error to the terminal.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%crud` `task`.

***

### `%talk` <a href="#talk" id="talk"></a>

Print `tang` to terminal.

```hoon
[%talk p=(list tank)]
```

The `tank`s in `p` will be printed to the terminal, first to last.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%talk` `task`.

***

### `%text` <a href="#text" id="text"></a>

Print `tape` to terminal.

```hoon
[%text p=tape]
```

The `tape` in `p` will be printed to the terminal.

#### Returns

Dill does not return a `gift` in response to a `%text` `task`.
