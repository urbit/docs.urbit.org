# Khan API Reference

These are the `task`s Khan can be passed and the `gift`s it can give.

## Tasks {#tasks}

Here are the `task`s you can pass Khan. You'd either use [`%fard`](#fard) to run a thread from a file or [`%lard`](#lard) to run an in-line thread.

### `%fard` {#fard}

Run a thread from within Arvo.

```hoon
[%fard p=(fyrd cage)]
```

`p` contains the thread location, name, and start arguments. See the [`fyrd`](types.md#fyrd) data type reference entry for details.

#### Returns

When the thread finishes, either by succeeding or failing, Khan will return an [`%arow`](#arow) gift.

---

### `%fyrd` {#fyrd}

External thread.

```hoon
[%fyrd p=(fyrd cast)]
```

This is passed to Khan by the runtime when a thread is run externally. You would not use this from userspace.

---

### `%lard` {#lard}

In-line thread.

```hoon
[%lard =bear =shed]
```

The [`bear`](types.md#bear) is either a `desk` or `beak`. The `shed` is the thread itself. Since Spider doesn't need to read out the thread from Clay, the `bear` doesn't do much apart from be included in the thread name that Spider generates. Khan will have Spider run the given thread, and eventually give an [`%arow`](#arow) gift back with the result.

#### Returns

When the thread eventually finishes (or if it fails), Khan with give an [`%arow`](#arow) gift back with the result.

---

## Gifts {#gifts}

These are the two `gift`s Khan can give. In userspace, you'd only receive an [`%arow`](#arow).

### `%arow` {#arow}

In-arvo result.

```hoon
[%arow p=(avow cage)]
```

This gift contains the result of a finished thread if successful, or an error and stack trace if it failed. It's given for threads run from within Arvo. See the [`avow`](types.md#avow) entry in the types reference for more details.

---

### `%avow` {#avow}

External result.

```hoon
[%avow p=(avow page)]
```

This gift contains the result of running a thread externally. You would not receive this in userspace.


A `page` is a pair of `mark` and `noun`. See the [`avow`](types.md#avow) entry in the types reference for more details of that mold builder.
