In this document we'll walk through an example of creating and publishing a desk that others can install. We'll create a simple "Hello World!" front-end with a "Hello" tile to launch it. For simplicity, the desk won't include an actual Gall agent, but we'll note everything necessary if there were one.

## Install binary

*Note: You can skip this step if you already have the latest binary installed.*

Follow the [CLI install
instructions](/manual/getting-started/self-hosted/self-hosted/cli#2-install-urbit) appropriate
for your OS to download the `urbit` binary.

## Spin up fake ship

*Note: You can skip this step if you already have a fake `zod`.*

With the `urbit` binary installed, run the following in the terminal to spin up
a fake `zod`:

```sh
./urbit -F zod
```

It will take a couple of minutes to spin up, but it should eventually take you
to a Dojo prompt like:

```
~zod:dojo>
```

## Create desk

In the Dojo of your fake `zod`, run the following to create a new desk called `%hello`:

```
|new-desk %hello
```

If you now run `+tree` on the desk, you'll see it now exists and has a handful
of files in it:

```
> +tree /=hello=
/mar/hoon/hoon
/mar/kelvin/hoon
/mar/noun/hoon
/mar/txt/hoon
/sys/kelvin
```

## Copy in extra files

Each desk must be self-contained in terms of its `mark` files and libraries.
There's a couple of extra mark files and such that we'll need to add, so run the
following commands in the Dojo:

```
|cp %/mar/mime/hoon /=hello=/mar/mime/hoon
|cp %/mar/txt-diff/hoon /=hello=/mar/txt-diff/hoon
|cp %/mar/ship/hoon /=hello=/mar/ship/hoon
|cp %/mar/bill/hoon /=hello=/mar/bill/hoon
|cp /=garden=/mar/docket-0/hoon /=hello=/mar/docket-0/hoon
|cp /=garden=/sur/docket/hoon /=hello=/sur/docket/hoon
|cp /=garden=/lib/docket/hoon /=hello=/lib/docket/hoon
```

## Mount the desk

Now we have all the basic files we need, we can mount the desk to the host. Run the following in the Dojo:

```
|mount %hello
```

Now, in an ordinary terminal (not the Dojo), navigate to the mounted desk:

```sh
cd zod/hello
```

## Config files

### `sys.kelvin`

Our desk must include a `sys.kelvin` file which specifies the kernel version
it's compatible with. The `|new-desk` generator automatically added that, so we
can leave it as-is.

### `desk.ship`

We can optionally add a `desk.ship` file to specify the original publisher of
this desk. We're using a fake `zod` so let's just add `~zod` as the publisher:

```sh
echo "~zod" > desk.ship
```

### `desk.bill`

If we had Gall agents in this desk which should be automatically started when
the desk is installed, we'd add them to a `hoon` list in the `desk.bill` file.
It would look something like this:

```hoon
:~  %some-app
    %another
==
```

In this example we're not adding any agents, so we'll simply omit the `desk.bill` file.

### `desk.docket-0`

The final file we need is `desk.docket-0`. This one's more complicated, so we'll
open it in our preferred text editor:

```sh
nano desk.docket-0
```

In the text editor, we'll add the following:
```hoon

:~  title+'Hello'
    info+'A simple hello world app.'
    color+0x81.88c9
    image+'https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/wut.svg'
    base+'hello'
    glob-ames+[~zod 0v0]
    version+[0 0 1]
    website+'https://developers.urbit.org/userspace/apps/guides/software-distribution'
    license+'MIT'
==
```

You can refer to the [Docket File](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket)
documentation for more details of what is required. In brief, the
`desk.docket-0` file contains a `hoon` list of
[clauses](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket) which configure the appearance of
the app tile, the source of the [glob](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/glob), and
some other metadata.

We've given the app a [`%title`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#title) of
"Hello", which will be displayed on the app tile and will be the name of the app
when others browse to install it. We've given the app tile a
[`%color`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#color) of `#8188C9`, and also
specified the URL of an [`%image`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#image) to
display on the tile.

The [`%base`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#base) clause specifies the base
URL path for the app. We've specified "hello" so it'll be
`http://localhost:8080/apps/hello/...` in the browser. For the
[glob](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/glob), we've used a clause of
[`%glob-ames`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#glob-ames), which means the
glob will be served from a ship over Ames, as opposed to being served over HTTP
with a [`%glob-http`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#glob-http) clause or
having an Eyre binding with a [`%site`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#site)
clause. You can refer to the [glob](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/glob)
documentation for more details of the glob options. In our case we've specified
`[~zod 0v0]`. Since `~zod` is the fakeship we'll install it on, the `%docket`
agent will await a separate upload of the `glob`, so we can just specify `0v0`
here as it'll get overwritten later.

The [`%version`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#version) clause specifies the
version as a triple of major version, minor version and patch version. The rest
is just some additional informative metadata which will be displayed in _App
Info_.

So let's save that to the `desk.docket-0` file and have a look at our desk:

```sh
ls
desk.docket-0  desk.ship  lib  mar  sur  sys.kelvin
```

## Commit

Now we've added out configuration files, we can commit them to the desk. Back in
the fake `zod`'s Dojo, run the following:

```
|commit %hello
```

You should see something like this as the result:

```
>=
+ /~zod/hello/9/desk/ship
+ /~zod/hello/9/desk/docket-0
```

## Install

The next step is to install the desk as an app. Run the following in the Dojo:

```
|install our %hello
```

You should see a message like:

```
docket: awaiting manual glob for %hello desk
```

That's because our `desk.docket-0` file includes a
[`%glob-ames`](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/docket#glob-ames) clause which
specifies our ship as the source, so it's waiting for us to upload the glob of
front-end files.

## Create files for glob

We'll now create the files for the glob. We'll use a very simple static HTML
page that just displayes "Hello World!" and an image. Typically we'd have a more
complex JS web app that talked to apps on our ship through Eyre's channel
system, but for the sake of simplicity we'll forgo that. Let's hop back in the
Unix terminal and run a few commands:

```sh
cd ~
mkdir hello-glob
cd hello-glob
mkdir img
wget -P img https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/pot.svg
```

We should now have the following file structure in our home directory:

```
hello-glob
└── img
    └── pot.svg
```

We've grabbed an image to use in our "Hello world!" page. The next thing we need
to add is an `index.html` file in the root of the folder. The `index.html` file
is mandatory; it's what will be loaded when the app's tile is clicked. Let's
open our preferred editor and create it:

```sh
nano index.html
```

In the editor, paste in the following HTML and save it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      div {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <title>Hello World</title>
  <body>
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <img src="img/pot.svg" alt="pot" width="219" height="196" />
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Our `hello-glob` folder should now look like this:

```
hello-glob
├── img
│   └── pot.svg
└── index.html
```

## Login to Landscape

Open a web browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`, or just `localhost` if port
`8080` doesn't work. It should take you to the fake `zod`'s login screen. Login
with the default code of `lidlut-tabwed-pillex-ridrup`.

Once you login, you'll notice you have the `Hello` app tile, but it still says
"installing" because we haven't uploaded the glob yet:

![hello installing tile](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-installing.png)

## Upload to glob

We can now create a glob from the `hello-glob` directory we previously created.
To do so, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/docket/upload` in the browser. This
will bring up the `%docket` app's
[Globulator](/userspace/apps/reference/dist/glob#globulator) tool:

![Globulator](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-globulator.png)

Simply select the `hello` desk from the drop-down, click `Choose file` and
select the `hello-glob` folder in the the file browser, then hit `glob!`.

Now if we return to our ship's homescreen, we should see the tile looks as we
specified in the docket file:

![Installed Tile](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-installed-tile.png)

And if we click on the tile, it'll load the `index.html` in our glob:

![Hello World!](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-hello-world.png)

Our app is working!

## Publish

The final step is publishing our desk with the `%treaty` agent so others can
install it. To do this, there's a simple command in the dojo:

```
> :treaty|publish %hello
>=
```

Note: For desks without a docket file (and therefore without a tile and glob),
treaty can't be used. Instead you can make the desk public with `|public
%desk-name`.

## Remote install

Let's spin up another fake ship in the terminal so we can try install it:

```sh
cd ~
./urbit -F bus
```

Note: For desks without a docket file (and therefore without a tile and glob),
users cannot install them through the web interface. Instead remote users can
install it from the dojo with `|install ~our-ship %desk-name`.

In the browser, navigate to `localhost:8081` (or `localhost:8080` if that
doesn't work)  and login with `~bus`'s code `riddec-bicrym-ridlev-pocsef`. Next,
type `~zod` in the search bar and click on the matching result. It should pop up
a list of `zod`'s published apps, which in this case is our `Hello` app:

![Remote install search](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-zod-apps.png)

When we click on the app, it'll show some of the information from the clauses in
the docket file:

![Remote app info](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-hello-info.png)

Click `Get App` and it'll ask as if we want to install it:

![Remote app install](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-install-hello.png)

Finally, click `Get "Hello"` and it'll be installed as a tile on `~bus` which
can then be opened:

![Remote app finished](https://media.urbit.org/guides/additional/dist/2-hello-installed-bus.png)
